This book pinpoints the most dangerous hacks and exploits specific to networks, laying out the anatomy of these attacks including how to make your system more secure. You will discover the best ways to defend against these vicious hacks with step-by-step instruction and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable. The book consists of seven chapters that deal with the following attacks: denial of service; war dialing; penetration testing; protocol tunneling; spanning tree attacks; man-in-the-middle; and password replay. These attacks are not mutually exclusive and were chosen because they help illustrate different aspects of network security. The principles on which they rely are unlikely to vanish any time soon, and they allow for the possibility of gaining something of interest to the attacker, from money to high-value data. This book is intended to provide practical, usable information. However, the world of network security is evolving very rapidly, and the attack that works today may (hopefully) not work tomorrow. It is more important, then, to understand the principles on which the attacks and exploits are based in order to properly plan either a network attack or a network defense. Seven Deadliest Network Attacks will appeal to information security professionals of all levels, network admins, and recreational hackers.

    annotation: "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds."

    annotation: "Virgin Lands: Two Years in Kazakhstan, 1954-5 focuses on the life, career, and experiences of L. I. Brezhnev when he stayed in Kazakhstan to push for the improvement of the agriculture sector of the country. The book first offers information on the experiences of L. I. Brezhnev as a farmer, land-use surveyor, metallurgist, factory worker, and politician. Brezhnev underscores how he pushed for the organization of collective farms. The text also highlights the poor state of agriculture in the country, including the farming methodologies that Brezhnev and his countrymen have adopted to overcome the extreme conditions of farming lands. The manuscript details the improvement of state farms, particularly noting the increase in harvest and the number of farms to be set up. Brezhnev narrates how the state farms are affected by drought and extreme weather conditions, and how they have doubled the crop areas through the use of farm implements. The book also underscores the role of farm machineries in the increase of production of grain, meat, and vegetables. The text is a dependable source of data for readers interested in the life and career of L. I. Brezhnev, particularly his dedication to develop agriculture in Kazakhstan."

    annotation: "There is considerably more skill in the IT and security communities than is reflected in the jobs people are able to attain. Most people's limiting factor in their ability to get better jobs is not technical skills or even the soft skills necessary to do well in a new job. It is that getting a job is a completely different skill set and one that most people only practice every few years. Job Reconnaissance: Using Hacking Skills to Win the Job Hunt Game explains the job hunting process, why the most commonly followed models fail and how to better approach the search. It covers the entire job hunt process from when to decide to leave your current job, research new possible job opportunities, targeting your new boss, controlling the job interview process and negotiating your new compensation and the departure from your current job. This is not a complete all-in-one job-hunting book. This book assumes that the reader is reasonably competent and has already heard most of the \"standard\" advice, but is having difficulty putting the advice into practice. The goal is to fill in the gaps of the other books and to help the readers use their technical skills to their advantage in a different context. The emphasis in Job Reconnaissance is for infosec and IT job seekers to leverage the same skills they use in penetration testing and recon toward job-hunting success. These skills include targeting, reconnaissance and profiling combined with a technical look at skills other career search books commonly miss. Covers the entire job hunt process from when to decide to leave your current job to the departure of your current job Suggests how to research new possible job opportunities Shows how to target your new boss, controlling the job interview process and negotiating your new compensation"

This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * Explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organization. * Examples of how risks are quantified and explanations of how risk exposure can have a real ‘material’ financial impact on an organization * Provides best practice examples along with case studies that demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organizations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally"

    annotation: "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds."

    annotation: "Accounting for Improvement offers concrete and constructive demonstrations of the possibilities of designing participative forms of organization. Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment."

    annotation: "Now in its 20th edition, \"Advances in Accounting\" continues to provide an important forum for discourse among and between academic and practicing accountants on issues of significance to the future of the discipline. Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment."

    annotation: "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job! You have made a complex subject highly accessible. It is very readable for anyone engaged in business whether in a small firm or a major corporation. - Peter Hutton, Managing Director of Brand Energy Research and formerly Group Development Director for MORI “Great concept: nicely executed and well written.

Brezhnev when he stayed in Kazakhstan to push for the improvement of the agriculture sector of the country. The book first offers information on the experiences of L. I. Brezhnev as a farmer, land-use surveyor, metallurgist, factory worker, and politician. Brezhnev underscores how he pushed for the organization of collective farms. The text also highlights the poor state of agriculture in the country, including the farming methodologies that Brezhnev and his countrymen have adopted to overcome the extreme conditions of farming lands. The manuscript details the improvement of state farms, particularly noting the increase in harvest and the number of farms to be set up. Brezhnev narrates how the state farms are affected by drought and extreme weather conditions, and how they have doubled the crop areas through the use of farm implements. The book also underscores the role of farm machineries in the increase of production of grain, meat, and vegetables. The text is a dependable source of data for readers interested in the life and career of L. I. Brezhnev, particularly his dedication to develop agriculture in Kazakhstan."

Most people's limiting factor in their ability to get better jobs is not technical skills or even the soft skills necessary to do well in a new job. It is that getting a job is a completely different skill set and one that most people only practice every few years. Job Reconnaissance: Using Hacking Skills to Win the Job Hunt Game explains the job hunting process, why the most commonly followed models fail and how to better approach the search. It covers the entire job hunt process from when to decide to leave your current job, research new possible job opportunities, targeting your new boss, controlling the job interview process and negotiating your new compensation and the departure from your current job.

This book assumes that the reader is reasonably competent and has already heard most of the \"standard\" advice, but is having difficulty putting the advice into practice.

The emphasis in Job Reconnaissance is for infosec and IT job seekers to leverage the same skills they use in penetration testing and recon toward job-hunting success. These skills include targeting, reconnaissance and profiling combined with a technical look at skills other career search books commonly miss.

Coding – The ability to program and script is quickly becoming a mainstream requirement for just about everyone in the security industry. This section covers the basics in coding complemented with a slue of programming tips and tricks in C/C++, Java, Perl and NASL. 2. Sockets – The technology that allows programs and scripts to communicate over a network is sockets. Even though the theory remains the same – communication over TCP and UDP, sockets are implemented differently in nearly ever language. 3. Shellcode – Shellcode, commonly defined as bytecode converted from Assembly, is utilized to execute commands on remote systems via direct memory access. 4. Porting – Due to the differences between operating platforms and language implementations on those platforms, it is a common practice to modify an original body of code to work on a different platforms. This technique is known as porting and is incredible useful in the real world environments since it allows you to not “recreate the wheel. 5. Coding Tools – The culmination of the previous four sections, coding tools brings all of the techniques that you have learned to the forefront. With the background technologies and techniques you will now be able to code quick utilities that will not only make you more productive, they will arm you with an extremely valuable skill that will remain with you as long as you make the proper time and effort dedications. *Contains never before seen chapters on writing and automating exploits on windows systems with all-new exploits. *Perform zero-day exploit forensics by reverse engineering malicious code. *Provides working code and scripts in all of the most common programming languages for readers to use TODAY to defend their networks."

The sea lanes are of particular importance for the East Asian region, as most trade is undertaken on the ocean. Booming economies in the region such as China and Vietnam put more pressure on sea lanes, triggering concern for the safety of navigation. Securing the Safety of Navigation in East Asia identifies salient issues for academic debate, and further explores those that have practical implications for the safety of navigation in East Asia. Contemporary maritime security concentrates on safe navigation and inhibiting transnational crimes, including sea piracy and maritime terrorism. Maritime environmental security and search and rescue at sea are also important. Securing the Safety of Navigation in East Asia is structured into four sections: the first part introduces the topic, and looks at the safety of navigation and the search for a cooperative mechanism. The second part considers the international legal framework and its implications for East Asia. The third part presents national perspectives on the safety of navigation, and fi nally part four considers navigational issues in the South China Sea. Places a special focus on East Asia Accommodates national perspectives in East Asia on navigation given by scholars from China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore Presents a special section on the South China Sea, located in Southeast Asia and connecting the Indian and Pacific oceans; a critical sea route for maritime transport"

Only through an understanding of the dynamics of cocoa cycles can policy decisions be made through the various phases of supply cycles. Based on a major international cocoa conference, this book presents seventeen edited papers from leading experts, making a major contribution to that understanding. It explains the powerful economic, social and political factors which impact on the cocoa economy. It shows the laws of cocoa supply are closely linked to environmental, ecological and institutional factors."

In Black Hat Physical Device Security: Exploiting Hardware and Software, the Black Hat experts show readers the types of attacks that can be done to physical devices such as motion detectors, video monitoring and closed circuit systems, authentication systems, thumbprint and voice print devices, retina scans, and more. The Black Hat Briefings held every year in Las Vegas, Washington DC, Amsterdam, and Singapore continually expose the greatest threats to cyber security and provide IT mind leaders with ground breaking defensive techniques. There are no books that show security and networking professionals how to protect physical security devices. This unique book provides step-by-step instructions for assessing the vulnerability of a security device such as a retina scanner, seeing how it might be compromised, and taking protective measures. The book covers the actual device as well as the software that runs it. By way of example, a thumbprint scanner that allows the thumbprint to remain on the glass from the last person could be bypassed by pressing a \"gummy bear\" piece of candy against the glass so that the scan works against the last thumbprint that was used on the device. This is a simple example of an attack against a physical authentication system.

    annotation: "This book covers what an administrator needs to plan out and integrate a DMZ into a network for small, medium and Enterprise networks. In most enterprises the perception is that a firewall provides a hardened perimeter. However, the security of internal networks and hosts is usually very soft. In such an environment, a non-DMZ system that is offering services to the Internet creates the opportunity to leapfrog to other hosts in the soft interior of your network. In this scenario your internal network is fair game for any attacker who manages to penetrate your so-called hard perimeter. - There are currently no books written specifically on DMZs - This book will be unique in that it will be the only book that teaches readers how to build a DMZ using all of these products: ISA Server, Check Point NG, Cisco Routers, Sun Servers, and Nokia Security Appliances. - Dr. Thomas W. Shinder is the author of the best-selling book on Microsoft's ISA, Configuring ISA Server 2000. Customers of the first book will certainly buy this book."

A significant barrier that companies have difficulty to overcome is the effective communication with their Chinese counter parts.

This book offers the solution to this problem: the bi-cultural personnel.

    annotation: "For more than two decades Australia has not only prospered without a recession but has achieved a higher growth rate than any Western country. This achievement has been credited to Australia’s historic shift to Asia; the transformation of the relationship between these two countries is one of the most important changes in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the role of new Chinese migrants in transforming Sino-Australian relations through their entrepreneurial activities has not been deeply explored. Chinese Migrant Entrepreneurship in Australia from the 1990s adds new theoretical considerations and empirical evidence to a growing interest in entrepreneurship, and presents an account of a group of new Chinese migrant entrepreneurs who have succeeded in their business ventures significantly contributing to both Australia and China. The first chapter introduces the history between Australia and China, followed by chapters focusing on post-migration realities, economic opportunities, Chinese outbound tourism and the use of community media. The final chapter concludes with a summary. Focuses on the people whose entrepreneurial activities have spread across industries and facilitated trade and cultural contacts Analyses the experiences of the new migrants from China Offers evidence that challenges outdated but still widely held assumptions about ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs Presents longitudinal research on the new Chinese migrant community in Australia since the late 1980’s Demonstrates a dynamic process that challenges the overemphasis on the impact of globalisation on Chinese entrepreneurs"

Accepted by major vehicle manufacturers as an alternative to the existing US, German, French and Italian automotive quality system requirements, this Technical Specification defines specific requirements for the application of ISO 9001: 1994 throughout the automotive supply chain. While initially the standard will be voluntary, for the first time, second and third tier suppliers may be faced with pressure to undergo third party registration. After the year 2000, the next version of the standard has actually replaced the four existing standards, (AVSQ, EAQF, QS-9000 and VDA 6 1) and the price of entry to the global automotive market is conformance to this new standard. This handbook is an essential and comprehensive guide to enable organizations to interpret and implement the ISO/TS 16949. Unlike other books on the subject, each element, clause and requirement is analyzed in detail with guidance provided for its implementation. The handbook is written primarily for implementers and discerning managers, for instructors and auditors and contains a range of solutions that would be acceptable in the automobile industry. It includes details of the certification scheme, the differences with existing standards, check lists, questionnaires, tips for implementers, flow charts and a glossary of terms.

    annotation: "Written for managers and professionals in business and industry, this book helps the reader in: * Understanding what is and is not IFRS * Learning the complexities of IFRS implementation * Appreciating the contribution of IFRS to corporate governance The changeover from the mosaic of different heterogeneous national accounting standards to the International Financial Reporting Standards has not been easy. For many companies IFRS, and most particularly the concept of fair value in IAS 39, has amounted to a phase shift – which is prerequisite to achieving compliant financial reporting. The research conducted by Dr. Chorafas for this book, documented that the process of meeting IFRS requirements presents opportunities and challenges to all enterprises. As many companies have found out, abandoning the classical accruals accounting for marking-to-market their transactions and portfolio positions, has not been easy. The conversion process has affected several functions within the organization including balance sheets, P&L statements, auditing, risk control, information systems, and management accounting. This book is in made up of four parts: * Part One focuses on business competition, standards boards, corporate accounting, and IAS 39 * The theme of Part Two, is the implementation of IFRS, exemplified through case studies on task forces and practical applications * Part Three brings together IFRS and management accounting requirements, with emphasis on fair value. * Part Four addresses itself to the contribution IFRS can make to better corporate governance, and to rebuilding the balance sheet The book has many case studies based on actual experiences. These range from the implementation of IFRS directives such as hedge accounting, to developing practices of real-time balance sheets; the help provided by sophisticated accounting solutions help in stress testing; and a comprehensive definition of the role of the audit committee. * A clear and practical view of the complexities of IFRS implementation * Includes practical case studies from real-life companies going through the process * Pays particular attention to IAS 39 on Fair Value"

No other single work exists which reviews this important identification process from beginning to end. We examine the identification process for latent (crime scene) prints and how they are identified with these systems. While the primary focus is automated fingerprint identifications, the book also touches on the emergence and use of fingerprints in other biometric systems. Criminal justice administrators, policy makers, and students of forensic science and criminal justice will find a reference to the known limitations and advantages of these systems. This book provides information as to the critical and continual need for properly trained individuals as well as an understanding of the direct and indirect costs associated with maintaining these systems. An understanding of the entire system and what it means will prove invaluable. Why are there missed identifications? Why are identifications made on one database that are not made on another database? Key terms and issues are included, and well as suggestions for improving the overall number of identifications. The book will go beyond process and also discuss issues such as interoperability, management strategies for large databases, contract development, lights out verification and several other issues which impact automated identifications. - The first comprehensive title on this subject area - Outlines in detail the entire process of fingerprint gathering and identity verification - The future of AFIS will is discussed, including national standards in developing multi-agency cooperation/interoperability (U.S.) in addition to the use of AFIS identification world-wide."

Three sets of questions are especially salient. First, how can firms operating in, or from, Asia detect, respect, recognize, and honor different cultural stances on suggestion-giving, knowledge sharing, and standardization while also challenging accepted wisdom, avoiding risks and mistakes, and voicing disagreement? Second, how can such firms facilitate local experimentation and innovation by providing a common knowledge platform in a non-totalitarian manner? Finally, how can such forums promote ‘reverse’ knowledge transfer from subsidiary to headquarters and across subsidiaries in different nations by avoiding ethnocentricity, cultivating local talent, and building a group of 'communities of practice' across cultural and status boundaries?

    annotation: "Many organizations struggle with the dynamics and the complexity of today's social ecosystems that connect everyone and everything, everywhere and all the time. Facing challenges at the intersection of business models, technical developments, and human needs, modern enterprises must overcome the siloed thinking and isolated efforts of the past, and instead address their relationships to people holistically. In Intersection, Milan Guenther introduces a Strategic Design approach that aligns the overarching efforts of Branding, Enterprise Architecture, and Experience Design, and sets them on a common course to shape tomorrow’s enterprises. This book gives designers, entrepreneurs, innovators, and leaders a model and a comprehensive vocabulary for tackling such deep-rooted challenges. The Enterprise Design framework cuts through the complexity of Strategic Design work, showing how to navigate key aspects and bridge diverging viewpoints. In 9 case studies, the author looks at the way companies like SAP, BBVA, IKEA, and Jeppesen (a Boeing Company) apply design thinking and practice to shape their enterprises. Moving from strategy to conceptual design and concrete results, Intersection shows what is relevant at which point, and what expertise to involve. Teaches how to align business strategy with Brand Identity, Customer Experience, and Enterprise Architecture initiatives as part of a consolidated enterprise-wide design practice to achieve stakeholder value Provides a framework for designing systems, products and services as the building blocks of a consistent and coherent experience for all stakeholders in the wider enterprise, joining strategic considerations with the delivery of tangible outcomes Explains how to make results such as websites, apps, objects, platforms, or environments part of a larger system that orchestrates enterprise touchpoints with people"

    annotation: "There is a growing interest in firms’ adoption of ethical and social marketing approaches among academics and practitioners alike. Ethical Marketing is the application of ethics into the marketing process, and Social Marketing is a concept that seeks to influence a target audience for the greater social good. Ethical and Social Marketing in Asia examines this so-far unexplored area, investigating why differing cultures and consumption behaviours require different emphasis in different markets. The diversity of the Asian countries provides a perplexing environment to the development and management of ethical and social marketing. The belief that bottom line profits is enough for a company, is often not favourably viewed by Asian countries emphasising collective, social and long term benefits for the people and country. Due to these interesting characteristics and complexities, the study of ethical and social marketing in Asia is a timely topic. The first chapters introduce Ethical Marketing in Asia, followed by case studies of how the approach is used across 14 diverse economies, geographically based on ‘clusters’; North East, (China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea), South East (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia) and South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh). The second part discusses Social Marketing using the same sequence of regions and economies and the third part explores the unique link to Fairness Management in Asia, followed by a conclusion. explores the nature of ethical and social marketing from an Asian perspective discusses current ethical and social marketing researches and practices in different areas, industries, commercial and non-commercial sectors serves as an invaluable resource for marketing academics and practitioners requiring more than anecdotal evidence of different ethical and social marketing applications compares and contrasts unethical situations covering important aspects related to ethics, society and fairness includes an interesting mix of theory, research findings and practices"

C# for Java Programmers will prepare readers for the .NET framework by building on what they already know about object-oriented languages and give them the means to maintain their flexibility and effectiveness in an un-certain marketplace. This book will compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of both Java and C# to allow programmers to make their own decisions regarding what each language is best used for. Whatever your feelings are about Microsoft and its .NET initiative, there can be no denying that C# is here to stay. The C# language, a close cousin to Java, is a new object-oriented programming language (OOPL) designed to work within the .NET framework. It improves upon many of the vague or ill-defined areas of C++ that frequently lead programmers into trouble. C# is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language designed to give the optimum blend of simplicity, expressiveness, and performance. Written specifically for Java programmers. C# for Java Programmers is not an introductory guide to C#, but builds on what Java programmers already know about object-oriented languages to give them an efficient means for making in-roads to the .NET framework. Compare and Contrast. This book will compare and contrast many of the advantages and drawbacks of Java and C# to allow programmers to make informed, intelligent decisions based on the unique uses of each language."

    annotation: "Budgeting is at the heart of the performance management process for most companies. However, some argue that many companies today are dissatisfied with budgeting. It is seen to be costly and time-consuming; it inhibits action and causes organisational problems. The influence of the \"Beyond Budgeting\" model has caused many major companies, including Toyota, to abandon traditional budgeting altogether. Should other companies follow suit? Budgeting Practice and Organisational Structure explores the changes in budgeting through a survey of financial and non-financial managers. Concerns include: The attitudes of managers towards budgeting models How budgetary practices have changed What problems budgeting can cause The effects of budgets on overall company performance. This report reveals that there’s little evidence to suggest widespread dissatisfaction with traditional budgeting. However, to enable a company to perform at its best, understanding budgeting in context is essential and it is imperative that budgeting works in tandem with other control systems and organisational structure.

    annotation: "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds."

It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment."

Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment."

    annotation: "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job!

The manuscript details the improvement of state farms, particularly noting the increase in harvest and the number of farms to be set up. Brezhnev narrates how the state farms are affected by drought and extreme weather conditions, and how they have doubled the crop areas through the use of farm implements. The book also underscores the role of farm machineries in the increase of production of grain, meat, and vegetables. The text is a dependable source of data for readers interested in the life and career of L. I. Brezhnev, particularly his dedication to develop agriculture in Kazakhstan."

XSS Attacks starts by defining the terms and laying out the ground work. It assumes that the reader is familiar with basic web programming (HTML) and JavaScript. First it discusses the concepts, methodology, and technology that makes XSS a valid concern. It then moves into the various types of XSS attacks, how they are implemented, used, and abused. After XSS is thoroughly explored, the next part provides examples of XSS malware and demonstrates real cases where XSS is a dangerous risk that exposes internet users to remote access, sensitive data theft, and monetary losses. Finally, the book closes by examining the ways developers can avoid XSS vulnerabilities in their web applications, and how users can avoid becoming a victim.

    annotation: "This book is the definitive guide on the OSSEC Host-based Intrusion Detection system and frankly, to really use OSSEC you are going to need a definitive guide. Documentation has been available since the start of the OSSEC project but, due to time constraints, no formal book has been created to outline the various features and functions of the OSSEC product. This has left very important and powerful features of the product undocumented...until now! The book you are holding will show you how to install and configure OSSEC on the operating system of your choice and provide detailed examples to help prevent and mitigate attacks on your systems. -- Stephen Northcutt OSSEC determines if a host has been compromised in this manner by taking the equivalent of a picture of the host machine in its original, unaltered state. This \"picture\" captures the most relevant information about that machine's configuration. OSSEC saves this \"picture\" and then constantly compares it to the current state of that machine to identify anything that may have changed from the original configuration. Now, many of these changes are necessary, harmless, and authorized, such as a system administrator installing a new software upgrade, patch, or application. But, then there are the not-so-harmless changes, like the installation of a rootkit, trojan horse, or virus. Differentiating between the harmless and the not-so-harmless changes determines whether the system administrator or security professional is managing a secure, efficient network or a compromised network which might be funneling credit card numbers out to phishing gangs or storing massive amounts of pornography creating significant liability for that organization. Separating the wheat from the chaff is by no means an easy task. Hence the need for this book. The book is co-authored by Daniel Cid, who is the founder and lead developer of the freely available OSSEC host-based IDS. As such, readers can be certain they are reading the most accurate, timely, and insightful information on OSSEC. * Nominee for Best Book Bejtlich read in 2008! * http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/best-book-bejtlich-read-in-2008.html • Get Started with OSSEC Get an overview of the features of OSSEC including commonly used terminology, pre-install preparation, and deployment considerations. • Follow Steb-by-Step Installation Instructions Walk through the installation process for the \"local , “agent , and \"server\" install types on some of the most popular operating systems available. • Master Configuration Learn the basic configuration options for your install type and learn how to monitor log files, receive remote messages, configure email notification, and configure alert levels. • Work With Rules Extract key information from logs using decoders and how you can leverage rules to alert you of strange occurrences on your network. • Understand System Integrity Check and Rootkit Detection Monitor binary executable files, system configuration files, and the Microsoft Windows registry. • Configure Active Response Configure the active response actions you want and bind the actions to specific rules and sequence of events. • Use the OSSEC Web User Interface Install, configure, and use the community-developed, open source web interface available for OSSEC. • Play in the OSSEC VMware Environment Sandbox • Dig Deep into Data Log Mining Take the “high art of log analysis to the next level by breaking the dependence on the lists of strings or patterns to look for in the logs."

Concepts and tactics are presented categorically so that even when a specifically detailed vulnerability has been patched, the foundational information provided will help hackers in writing a newer, better attack; or help pen testers, auditors, and the like develop a more concrete design and defensive structure.

Part II focuses on different operating systems and describes exploits for them that target various bug classes. Part III on remote kernel exploitation analyzes the effects of the remote scenario and presents new techniques to target remote issues. It includes a step-by-step analysis of the development of a reliable, one-shot, remote exploit for a real vulnerabilitya bug affecting the SCTP subsystem found in the Linux kernel. Finally, Part IV wraps up the analysis on kernel exploitation and looks at what the future may hold.

Object-orientation, application servers, web front-ends, and relational database systems dominate the scene for new projects today. The fact remains however, that millions of lines of source code written in the structured programming language COBOL work daily on computer systems all over the world. One problem that COBOL developers have to deal with on these new projects is familiarity with object-oriented concepts.

    annotation: "Disappearing Cryptography, Second Edition describes how to take words, sounds, or images and hide them in digital data so they look like other words, sounds, or images. When used properly, this powerful technique makes it almost impossible to trace the author and the recipient of a message. Conversations can be submerged in the flow of information through the Internet so that no one can know if a conversation exists at all. This full revision of the best-selling first edition describes a number of different techniques to hide information. These include encryption, making data incomprehensible; steganography, embedding information into video, audio, or graphics files; watermarking, hiding data in the noise of image or sound files; mimicry, \"dressing up\" data and making it appear to be other data, and more. The second edition also includes an expanded discussion on hiding information with spread-spectrum algorithms, shuffling tricks, and synthetic worlds. Each chapter is divided into sections, first providing an introduction and high-level summary for those who want to understand the concepts without wading through technical explanations, and then presenting greater detail for those who want to write their own programs. To encourage exploration, the author's Web site www.wayner.org/books/discrypt2/ contains implementations for hiding information in lists, sentences, and images. Each chapter is divided into sections, providing first an introduction and high-level summary for those who want to understand the concepts without wading through technical details, and then an introductory set of details, for those who want to write their own programs.

    annotation: "The book is logically divided into 5 main categories with each category representing a major skill set required by most security professionals: 1. Coding – The ability to program and script is quickly becoming a mainstream requirement for just about everyone in the security industry. This section covers the basics in coding complemented with a slue of programming tips and tricks in C/C++, Java, Perl and NASL. 2. Sockets – The technology that allows programs and scripts to communicate over a network is sockets. Even though the theory remains the same – communication over TCP and UDP, sockets are implemented differently in nearly ever language. 3. Shellcode – Shellcode, commonly defined as bytecode converted from Assembly, is utilized to execute commands on remote systems via direct memory access. 4. Porting – Due to the differences between operating platforms and language implementations on those platforms, it is a common practice to modify an original body of code to work on a different platforms. This technique is known as porting and is incredible useful in the real world environments since it allows you to not “recreate the wheel. 5. Coding Tools – The culmination of the previous four sections, coding tools brings all of the techniques that you have learned to the forefront. With the background technologies and techniques you will now be able to code quick utilities that will not only make you more productive, they will arm you with an extremely valuable skill that will remain with you as long as you make the proper time and effort dedications. *Contains never before seen chapters on writing and automating exploits on windows systems with all-new exploits. *Perform zero-day exploit forensics by reverse engineering malicious code. *Provides working code and scripts in all of the most common programming languages for readers to use TODAY to defend their networks."

    annotation: "User passwords are the keys to the network kingdom, yet most users choose overly simplistic passwords (like password) that anyone could guess, while system administrators demand impossible to remember passwords littered with obscure characters and random numerals. Every computer user must face the problems of password security. According to a recent British study, passwords are usually obvious: around 50 percent of computer users select passwords based on names of a family member, spouse, partner, or a pet. Many users face the problem of selecting strong passwords that meet corporate security requirements. Too often, systems reject user-selected passwords because they are not long enough or otherwise do not meet complexity requirements. This book teaches users how to select passwords that always meet complexity requirements. A typical computer user must remember dozens of passwords and they are told to make them all unique and never write them down. For most users, the solution is easy passwords that follow simple patterns. This book teaches users how to select strong passwords they can easily remember. * Examines the password problem from the perspective of the administrator trying to secure their network * Author Mark Burnett has accumulated and analyzed over 1,000,000 user passwords and through his research has discovered what works, what doesn't work, and how many people probably have dogs named Spot * Throughout the book, Burnett sprinkles interesting and humorous password ranging from the Top 20 dog names to the number of references to the King James Bible in passwords"

Maintaining and Evolving Successful Commercial Web Sites addresses the realities of successful sites today, namely the notion that maintaining and evolving a site is actually a bigger commitment than launching it. Management wants to maximize returns and obtain reliable performance data, customers demand better service and insist on sites that are more advanced yet easier to use, and the Web site must increasingly be integrated with the entire business even as the amount of information it handles continues to grow. Maintaining and Evolving Successful Commercial Web Sites focuses more on process, reality, and pragmatism and less on strategic theory. It provides the reader with the knowledge, tools, approaches, and processes to manage key site maintenance and evolution projects, providing answers to the following questions: *How can I better manage changes and updates to the Web site? *How can I scale up to allow more contributions to the site and more content and still maintain quality and control? *What is content management and how do I go about it? *How do I go about personalization or community building? *What is Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and how do I actually do it online? *How do I measure and report on how well the site is doing? *How do I avoid information overload? *How do I maximize the value the site creates?

    annotation: "Management Accounting is part of the celebrations to mark CIMA’s 90th anniversary in 2009. It looks at the development of cost and management accounting from the founding of the Institute to today. It considers a number of immediate challenges to management accountants and surveys a range of issues and challenges that will likely affect management accounting thought and practice in the future. The authors examine the possibilities for accountants to widen their focus and become more familiar with the enterprise technology determining their organisations’ cost structures and with the effects of multiple production in various locations, such as economies or diseconomies of scale. Such change may require the alteration of traditional cost models used by accountants to become more nuanced. The book suggests how this may be accomplished and highlights the need for management accountants to work as part of management teams throughout the organisation as business partners rather than remain grounded in specialist information provision roles. Alnoor Bhimani is Professor of Management Accounting at the London School of Economics. He is also a Certified Management Accountant as well as an author of 15 books and over 100 articles. Michael Bromwich was CIMA’s Professor of Accounting and Financial Management at the London School of Economics and Political Science (1985 to 2006), now Emeritus. He is a Past President of CIMA (1987/88) and currently serves on CIMA’s Technical Committee.

    annotation: "Service orchestration techniques combine the benefits of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Business Process Management (BPM) to compose and coordinate distributed software services. On the other hand, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is gaining popularity as a software delivery model through cloud platforms due to the many benefits to software vendors, as well as their customers. Multi-tenancy, which refers to the sharing of a single application instance across multiple customers or user groups (called tenants), is an essential characteristic of the SaaS model. Written in an easy to follow style with discussions supported by real-world examples, Service Orchestration as Organization introduces a novel approach with associated language, framework, and tool support to show how service orchestration techniques can be used to engineer and deploy SaaS applications.

    annotation: "The great strides made over the past decade in the complexity and network functionality of embedded systems have significantly enhanced their attractiveness for use in critical applications such as medical devices and military communications. However, this expansion into critical areas has presented embedded engineers with a serious new problem: their designs are now being targeted by the same malicious attackers whose predations have plagued traditional systems for years. Rising concerns about data security in embedded devices are leading engineers to pay more attention to security assurance in their designs than ever before. This is particularly challenging due to embedded devices’ inherent resource constraints such as limited power and memory. Therefore, traditional security solutions must be customized to fit their profile, and entirely new security concepts must be explored. However, there are few resources available to help engineers understand how to implement security measures within the unique embedded context. This new book from embedded security expert Timothy Stapko is the first to provide engineers with a comprehensive guide to this pivotal topic. From a brief review of basic security concepts, through clear explanations of complex issues such as choosing the best cryptographic algorithms for embedded utilization, the reader is provided with all the information needed to successfully produce safe, secure embedded devices. The ONLY book dedicated to a comprehensive coverage of embedded security! Covers both hardware- and software-based embedded security solutions for preventing and dealing with attacks Application case studies support practical explanations of all key topics, including network protocols, wireless and cellular communications, languages (Java and C/++), compilers, web-based interfaces, cryptography, and an entire section on SSL"

    annotation: "Ever-changing business needs have prompted large companies to rethink their enterprise IT. Today, businesses must allow interaction with their customers, partners, and employees at more touch points and at a depth never thought previously. At the same time, rapid advances in information technologies, like business digitization, cloud computing, and Web 2.0, demand fundamental changes in the enterprises’ management practices. These changes have a drastic effect not only on IT and business, but also on policies, processes, and people. Many companies therefore embark on enterprise-wide transformation initiatives. The role of Enterprise Architecture (EA) is to architect and supervise this transformational journey. Unfortunately, today’s EA is often a ponderous and detached exercise, with most of the EA initiatives failing to create visible impact. The enterprises need an EA that is agile and responsive to business dynamics. Collaborative Enterprise Architecture provides the innovative solutions today’s enterprises require, informed by real-world experiences and experts’ insights. This book, in its first part, provides a systematic compendium of the current best practices in EA, analyzes current ways of doing EA, and identifies its constraints and shortcomings. In the second part, it leaves the beaten tracks of EA by introducing Lean, Agile, and Enterprise 2.0 concepts to the traditional EA methods. This blended approach to EA focuses on practical aspects, with recommendations derived from real-world experiences. A truly thought provoking and pragmatic guide to manage EA, Collaborative Enterprise Architecture effectively merges the long-term oriented top-down approach with pragmatic bottom-up thinking, and that way offers real solutions to businesses undergoing enterprise-wide change. Covers the latest emerging technologies affecting business practice, including digitization, cloud computing, agile software development, and Web 2.0 Focuses on the practical implementation of EAM rather than theory, with recommendations based on real-world case studies Addresses changing business demands and practices, including Enterprise 2.0, open source, global sourcing, and more Takes an innovative approach to EAM, merging standard top-down and pragmatic, bottom-up strategies, offering real solutions to businesses undergoing enterprise-wide changes"

    annotation: "In 2010, India celebrated its 60th anniversary as an independent sovereign republic. India is the fourth largest economy by gross domestic product. Economically, it is building itself as a formidable force and global influence. At the same time India has fundamental challenges: its inequities are visible; its young population tread a thin line between opportunity and pitfall; its infrastructure has gaping holes; and it’s a slow chaotic democracy. This book establishes that in spite of these challenges, a new India is emerging out of the old, colliding more often than collaborating with the old India. Much of the new India is built on the economic momentum established 20 years ago and built by private entrepreneurs. The new economic climate, together with talent and entrepreneurship, is also making India a net supplier of innovation. Going by current trends, India will become an innovation super power by 2035. This book will establish that India is not just leveraging innovation for global competitiveness alone, but is also leveraging innovation as the specific instrument for inclusive growth. This book identifies gaps in the current innovation ecosystem and recommends a portfolio approach and calls for a National Innovation System (NIS) as a blueprint to fix the gaps. It suggests that for India to succeed in identifying, funding and sustaining a balanced innovation portfolio, India will also have to succeed in eliminating poverty, increase its rural GDP manifold, and provide employment, education and health for all its citizens. Click Here to view the official page for this title on Facebook. Establishes and analyses the trends that support India’s global emergence as an Innovation Superpower Identifies three critical levels of innovation namely grassroots innovation, national innovation and innovation for global competitiveness Recommends a portfolio approach as a blueprint for the creation of a National Innovation System"

    annotation: "This book is about women directors in China and India. The aim of the book is to understand more clearly where women are present on corporate boards, and the reasons for their continued absence from most listed company boards. The Glass Ceiling in Chinese and Indian Boardrooms is written at a time of increasing awareness, particularly in Europe, of the benefits of gender equity at the boardroom table, and of the costs of women’s continued exclusion from corporate decision-making. Norway’s gender equity legislation has now been instrumental in ensuring that women occupy over 40% of all company board seats in that country. France, Italy and Spain are amongst those countries now following the same path towards equity. But Asia in general, and the world’s two largest nations in particular, still lag well behind. In China while women enjoy greater social and economic equality than many of their sisters in other parts of Asia, the male-dominated nature of the Party-state apparatus makes it unlikely that legislative change will be achieved any time soon. In India, while the country’s 2013 Corporations Law now requires all major listed firms to have at least one woman director, the real challenges for women are social and economic, where much work remains to be done. Based on detailed surveys of 1,000 key listed firms in India and China Provides results from empirical questionnaire surveys of key firms Analyses the importance of board diversity in a rapidly changing world, and its significance for economic and environmental stability"

    annotation: "Linux servers now account for 33% of all networks servers running worldwide (Source: IDC). The top 3 market share holders in the network server space (IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell) all use Linux as their standard operating system. This book teaches Linux system administrators how to protect their servers from malicious threats. As with any technologies, increased usage results in increased attention from malicious hackers. For years a myth existed that Windows was inherently less secure than Linux, because there were significantly more attacks against Windows machines than Linux. This was a fallacy. There were more attacks against Windows machines because there were simply so many more Windows machines to attack. Now, the numbers tell the exact opposite story. Linux servers account for 1/3 of all servers worldwide, but in 2005 there were 3 times as many high-severity security vulnerabilities discovered on Linux servers (Source: IDC). This book covers Open Source security, implementing an intrusion detection system, unearthing Rootkits, defending against malware, creating Virtual Private Networks, and much more. The Perfect Reference for the Multitasked SysAdmin * Discover Why \"Measure Twice, Cut Once\" Applies to Securing Linux * Complete Coverage of Hardening the Operating System, Implementing an Intrusion Detection System, and Defending Databases * Short on Theory, History, and Technical Data that Is Not Helpful in Performing Your Job"

    annotation: "RFID is a method of remotely storing and receiving data using devices called RFID tags. RFID tags can be small adhesive stickers containing antennas that receive and respond to transmissions from RFID transmitters. RFID tags are used to identify and track everything from food, dogs, beer kegs to library books. RFID tags use a standard that has already been hacked by several researchers. RFID Security discusses the motives for someone wanting to hack an RFID system and shows how to protect systems. Coverage includes: security breaches for monetary gain (hacking a shops RFID system would allow a hacker to lower the pricing on any product products). How to protect the supply chain (malicous/mischievous hackers can delete/alter/modify all identifying information for an entire shipment of products). How to protect personal privacy (privacy advocates fear that RFID tags embedded in products, which continue to transmit information after leaving a store, will be used to track consumer habits). The purpose of an RFID system is to enable data to be transmitted by a portable device, called a tag, which is read by an RFID reader and processed according to the needs of a particular application. The data transmitted by the tag may provide identification or location information, or specifics about the product tagged, such as price, colour, date of purchase, etc. . * Deloitte & Touche expects over 10 billion RFID tags to be in circulation by the end of 2005 * Parties debating the security issue of RFID need information on the pros and cons of the technology and this is that information * Little competition in a market desperate for information"

    annotation: "The Basics of Web Hacking introduces you to a tool-driven process to identify the most widespread vulnerabilities in Web applications. No prior experience is needed. Web apps are a \"path of least resistance\" that can be exploited to cause the most damage to a system, with the lowest hurdles to overcome. This is a perfect storm for beginning hackers. The process set forth in this book introduces not only the theory and practical information related to these vulnerabilities, but also the detailed configuration and usage of widely available tools necessary to exploit these vulnerabilities. The Basics of Web Hacking provides a simple and clean explanation of how to utilize tools such as Burp Suite, sqlmap, and Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), as well as basic network scanning tools such as nmap, Nikto, Nessus, Metasploit, John the Ripper, web shells, netcat, and more. Dr. Josh Pauli teaches software security at Dakota State University and has presented on this topic to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the NSA, BlackHat Briefings, and Defcon. He will lead you through a focused, three-part approach to Web security, including hacking the server, hacking the Web app, and hacking the Web user. With Dr. Pauli’s approach, you will fully understand the what/where/why/how of the most widespread Web vulnerabilities and how easily they can be exploited with the correct tools. You will learn how to set up a safe environment to conduct these attacks, including an attacker Virtual Machine (VM) with all necessary tools and several known-vulnerable Web application VMs that are widely available and maintained for this very purpose. Once you complete the entire process, not only will you be prepared to test for the most damaging Web exploits, you will also be prepared to conduct more advanced Web hacks that mandate a strong base of knowledge. Provides a simple and clean approach to Web hacking, including hands-on examples and exercises that are designed to teach you how to hack the server, hack the Web app, and hack the Web user Covers the most significant new tools such as nmap, Nikto, Nessus, Metasploit, John the Ripper, web shells, netcat, and more!

    annotation: "In Bringing a Corporate Security Culture to Life, presenter Peter Cheviot, former vice president of corporate security for BAX Global Inc., discusses how to build and maintain a corporate security culture that encourages company employees to take ownership of security and facilitates communication. In this 18-minute video presentation of narrated slides, the concept of \"security culture\" is defined, and Cheviot explains how it can improve the effectiveness of security and risk management programs. Security culture refers to the idea that the security manager must encourage shared ownership of and accountability for the organization’s security program among all employees. In this presentation, the ways to achieve a good security culture are outlined. They include impressing the return on investment (ROI) of security services, designating security ambassadors for various functional areas of the business, providing training, connecting with senior management, and sharing security program performance results. When employees and other business stakeholders feel that they have ownership over security policies, the results are higher compliance, return on investment, and net gains through continuous improvements. The tools and recommendations found in Bringing a Corporate Security Culture to Life will help security managers and their teams achieve these results. Bringing a Corporate Security Culture to Life is a part of Elsevier’s Security Executive Council Risk Management Portfolio, a collection of real world solutions and \"how-to\" guidelines that equip executives, practitioners, and educators with proven information for successful security and risk management programs.

    annotation: "The primary goal of the Information Protection Playbook is to serve as a comprehensive resource for information protection (IP) professionals who must provide adequate information security at a reasonable cost. It emphasizes a holistic view of IP: one that protects the applications, systems, and networks that deliver business information from failures of confidentiality, integrity, availability, trust and accountability, and privacy. Using the guidelines provided in the Information Protection Playbook, security and information technology (IT) managers will learn how to implement the five functions of an IP framework: governance, program planning, risk management, incident response management, and program administration. These functions are based on a model promoted by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and validated by thousands of Certified Information Security Managers. The five functions are further broken down into a series of objectives or milestones to be achieved in order to implement an IP framework. The extensive appendices included at the end of the book make for an excellent resource for the security or IT manager building an IP program from the ground up. They include, for example, a board of directors presentation complete with sample slides; an IP policy document checklist; a risk prioritization procedure matrix, which illustrates how to classify a threat based on a scale of high, medium, and low; a facility management self-assessment questionnaire; and a list of representative job descriptions for roles in IP.

    annotation: "Is emergency management education undoing an age-old tradition in the American Fire Service? Has the time arrived to educate emergency managers in college classrooms rather than in twenty years of tactical operations experience? Over one hundred forty-three (143) institutions of higher education are now offering certificate or degree programs in emergency management with no tactical operations experience required for admission. Resistance by veteran law enforcement officers and fire fighters may have to be overcome if we are to prepare emergency managers with required skill sets. Dr. Tom Phelan explores the skills being taught to emergency management students and addresses the concerns of experienced first responders in accepting their leadership. *Discusses the value of emergency management education in the post-9/11 world *Makes clear the need for educating emergency managers to prepare them for emergency manager leadership *Helps bridge the gap between emergency management and first responders *Should be required reading in every college emergency management curriculum *The book is clear, concise, and an \"easy read\""

    annotation: "It is now seen as essential that all businesses assess their exposure to business risk especially in relation to value creation. This book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact it has on the value of your business. It offers vital, accessible and timely tools to assist you in making an immediate difference to the core value of your business and thereby satisfy the demands of an ever increasing range of stakeholders. This book will help you: • Discover how risk exposure can have a financial impact on your business • Make your business become more sustainable financially, socially and environmentally • Learn how to apply knowledge fast with this practical guide to risk management issues The sustainable approach covered by this book spans business survival to more recent issues, such as the use of energy and natural resources. It highlights the value of a more enlightened approach throughout an organization. In doing so the book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact on value using the Sustainable and Economic Risk Management (SERM) methodology which considers: • inherent risk • management of risk • residual risk exposure. By exploring the various frameworks that organizations operate in today – whether compulsory, compliance driven, voluntary or motivated by best practice – the book offers a practical tool through the SERM model which is at the heart of the book’s approach to risk management. This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * Explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organization. * Examples of how risks are quantified and explanations of how risk exposure can have a real ‘material’ financial impact on an organization * Provides best practice examples along with case studies that demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organizations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally"

    annotation: "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds."

Companies regularly reshape themselves continually exploring new markets and developing new products. When they can't expand into new markets or develop new products on their own, they seek alternatives. These alternatives include merging with or acquiring other companies to create a single more capable company. Companies acquire other companies for a wide variety of reasons. In some cases company survival may actually be the reason. What does this condition mean to the security professional? In the course of mergers and acquisitions, security plays a vital role in helping to make the endeavor successful. There are numerous titles on the business aspects of M&A such as the ones listed below. However, this unique book focuses on the role security plays in helping to make a merger, acquisition or divestiture successful. It addresses the fundamental security elements that are required to support the effort.

Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment."

Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment."

    annotation: "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job! You have made a complex subject highly accessible. It is very readable for anyone engaged in business whether in a small firm or a major corporation. - Peter Hutton, Managing Director of Brand Energy Research and formerly Group Development Director for MORI “Great concept: nicely executed and well written.

The manuscript details the improvement of state farms, particularly noting the increase in harvest and the number of farms to be set up. Brezhnev narrates how the state farms are affected by drought and extreme weather conditions, and how they have doubled the crop areas through the use of farm implements. The book also underscores the role of farm machineries in the increase of production of grain, meat, and vegetables.

    annotation: "Insecure transportation systems are costing our worldwide mobility-based economy as much as 6% of GDP annually. The effectiveness of security measures vary widely. In the United States, depending on the mode of transportation, it ranges from “medium effectiveness for airports to “low effectiveness for maritime, rail, transit, and intermodal activities. Situational awareness and interoperability are lacking as we try to deal with both natural and man-made disasters. Regardless of the transport mode, improvements are essential if governments and corporations are to address security planning, response, and national preparedness. Transportation Security examines this problem in a comprehensive manner and addresses security-based technologies and solutions to minimize risk. * Covers air, sea, roadway, rail and public transport modes * Offers technological solutions for mobility based problems in planning, logistics and policy to improve security, combat terrorism and ensure national preparedness * Includes work of international experts & global examples related to transportation security"

Job Reconnaissance: Using Hacking Skills to Win the Job Hunt Game explains the job hunting process, why the most commonly followed models fail and how to better approach the search. It covers the entire job hunt process from when to decide to leave your current job, research new possible job opportunities, targeting your new boss, controlling the job interview process and negotiating your new compensation and the departure from your current job.

Concepts and tactics are presented categorically so that even when a specifically detailed vulnerability has been patched, the foundational information provided will help hackers in writing a newer, better attack; or help pen testers, auditors, and the like develop a more concrete design and defensive structure. The book is organized into four parts. Part I introduces the kernel and sets out the theoretical basis on which to build the rest of the book. Part II focuses on different operating systems and describes exploits for them that target various bug classes. Part III on remote kernel exploitation analyzes the effects of the remote scenario and presents new techniques to target remote issues. It includes a step-by-step analysis of the development of a reliable, one-shot, remote exploit for a real vulnerabilitya bug affecting the SCTP subsystem found in the Linux kernel. Finally, Part IV wraps up the analysis on kernel exploitation and looks at what the future may hold. Covers a range of operating system families — UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, Windows Details common scenarios such as generic memory corruption (stack overflow, heap overflow, etc.) issues, logical bugs and race conditions Delivers the reader from user-land exploitation to the world of kernel-land (OS) exploits/attacks, with a particular focus on the steps that lead to the creation of successful techniques, in order to give to the reader something more than just a set of tricks"

    annotation: "Seven Deadliest Network Attacks identifies seven classes of network attacks and discusses how the attack works, including tools to accomplish the attack, the risks of the attack, and how to defend against the attack. This book pinpoints the most dangerous hacks and exploits specific to networks, laying out the anatomy of these attacks including how to make your system more secure. You will discover the best ways to defend against these vicious hacks with step-by-step instruction and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable. The book consists of seven chapters that deal with the following attacks: denial of service; war dialing; penetration testing; protocol tunneling; spanning tree attacks; man-in-the-middle; and password replay. These attacks are not mutually exclusive and were chosen because they help illustrate different aspects of network security. The principles on which they rely are unlikely to vanish any time soon, and they allow for the possibility of gaining something of interest to the attacker, from money to high-value data. This book is intended to provide practical, usable information. However, the world of network security is evolving very rapidly, and the attack that works today may (hopefully) not work tomorrow. It is more important, then, to understand the principles on which the attacks and exploits are based in order to properly plan either a network attack or a network defense. Seven Deadliest Network Attacks will appeal to information security professionals of all levels, network admins, and recreational hackers. Knowledge is power, find out about the most dominant attacks currently waging war on computers and networks globally Discover the best ways to defend against these vicious attacks; step-by-step instruction shows you how Institute countermeasures, don’t be caught defenseless again, and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable"

    annotation: "In reaction to the continually changing business climate companies develop many business strategies to increase their competitiveness and improve profitability. Companies regularly reshape themselves continually exploring new markets and developing new products. When they can't expand into new markets or develop new products on their own, they seek alternatives. These alternatives include merging with or acquiring other companies to create a single more capable company. Companies acquire other companies for a wide variety of reasons. In some cases company survival may actually be the reason. What does this condition mean to the security professional? In the course of mergers and acquisitions, security plays a vital role in helping to make the endeavor successful. There are numerous titles on the business aspects of M&A such as the ones listed below. However, this unique book focuses on the role security plays in helping to make a merger, acquisition or divestiture successful. It addresses the fundamental security elements that are required to support the effort. In addition, it provides an integrated \"how to\" approach to implementing M&A security complete with methods and processes that have been quickly and cost-effectively implemented. - First book available that focuses on the role of the Security Manager in M&A - Case studies that highlight the role of the security manager; cases include both best practices as well as illustrations of nightmare examples of what NOT to do - Lead author is an expert that has participated in/managed security for more than 20 high-profile and large-scale acquisitions - Model processes, procedures, checklists, charts and sample forms all serve to ease immediate analysis and implementation in a merger or acquisition"

    annotation: "Now in its 20th edition, \"Advances in Accounting\" continues to provide an important forum for discourse among and between academic and practicing accountants on issues of significance to the future of the discipline. Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment."

Dr. Tom Phelan explores the skills being taught to emergency management students and addresses the concerns of experienced first responders in accepting their leadership. *Discusses the value of emergency management education in the post-9/11 world *Makes clear the need for educating emergency managers to prepare them for emergency manager leadership *Helps bridge the gap between emergency management and first responders *Should be required reading in every college emergency management curriculum *The book is clear, concise, and an \"easy read\""

    annotation: "It is now seen as essential that all businesses assess their exposure to business risk especially in relation to value creation. This book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact it has on the value of your business. It offers vital, accessible and timely tools to assist you in making an immediate difference to the core value of your business and thereby satisfy the demands of an ever increasing range of stakeholders. This book will help you: • Discover how risk exposure can have a financial impact on your business • Make your business become more sustainable financially, socially and environmentally • Learn how to apply knowledge fast with this practical guide to risk management issues The sustainable approach covered by this book spans business survival to more recent issues, such as the use of energy and natural resources. It highlights the value of a more enlightened approach throughout an organization. In doing so the book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact on value using the Sustainable and Economic Risk Management (SERM) methodology which considers: • inherent risk • management of risk • residual risk exposure. By exploring the various frameworks that organizations operate in today – whether compulsory, compliance driven, voluntary or motivated by best practice – the book offers a practical tool through the SERM model which is at the heart of the book’s approach to risk management. This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * Explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organization. * Examples of how risks are quantified and explanations of how risk exposure can have a real ‘material’ financial impact on an organization * Provides best practice examples along with case studies that demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organizations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally"

    annotation: "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds."

    annotation: "In reaction to the continually changing business climate companies develop many business strategies to increase their competitiveness and improve profitability. Companies regularly reshape themselves continually exploring new markets and developing new products. When they can't expand into new markets or develop new products on their own, they seek alternatives. These alternatives include merging with or acquiring other companies to create a single more capable company. Companies acquire other companies for a wide variety of reasons. In some cases company survival may actually be the reason. What does this condition mean to the security professional? In the course of mergers and acquisitions, security plays a vital role in helping to make the endeavor successful. There are numerous titles on the business aspects of M&A such as the ones listed below. However, this unique book focuses on the role security plays in helping to make a merger, acquisition or divestiture successful. It addresses the fundamental security elements that are required to support the effort. In addition, it provides an integrated \"how to\" approach to implementing M&A security complete with methods and processes that have been quickly and cost-effectively implemented. - First book available that focuses on the role of the Security Manager in M&A - Case studies that highlight the role of the security manager; cases include both best practices as well as illustrations of nightmare examples of what NOT to do - Lead author is an expert that has participated in/managed security for more than 20 high-profile and large-scale acquisitions - Model processes, procedures, checklists, charts and sample forms all serve to ease immediate analysis and implementation in a merger or acquisition"

Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment."

Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment."

    annotation: "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job! You have made a complex subject highly accessible. It is very readable for anyone engaged in business whether in a small firm or a major corporation. - Peter Hutton, Managing Director of Brand Energy Research and formerly Group Development Director for MORI “Great concept: nicely executed and well written.

    annotation: "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds."

XSS Attacks starts by defining the terms and laying out the ground work. It assumes that the reader is familiar with basic web programming (HTML) and JavaScript. First it discusses the concepts, methodology, and technology that makes XSS a valid concern. It then moves into the various types of XSS attacks, how they are implemented, used, and abused. After XSS is thoroughly explored, the next part provides examples of XSS malware and demonstrates real cases where XSS is a dangerous risk that exposes internet users to remote access, sensitive data theft, and monetary losses.

    annotation: "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book.

    annotation: "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds."

Companies regularly reshape themselves continually exploring new markets and developing new products. When they can't expand into new markets or develop new products on their own, they seek alternatives. These alternatives include merging with or acquiring other companies to create a single more capable company. Companies acquire other companies for a wide variety of reasons. In some cases company survival may actually be the reason. What does this condition mean to the security professional? In the course of mergers and acquisitions, security plays a vital role in helping to make the endeavor successful. There are numerous titles on the business aspects of M&A such as the ones listed below. However, this unique book focuses on the role security plays in helping to make a merger, acquisition or divestiture successful.

    annotation: "Now in its 20th edition, \"Advances in Accounting\" continues to provide an important forum for discourse among and between academic and practicing accountants on issues of significance to the future of the discipline. Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment."

Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment."

This book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact it has on the value of your business. It offers vital, accessible and timely tools to assist you in making an immediate difference to the core value of your business and thereby satisfy the demands of an ever increasing range of stakeholders. This book will help you: • Discover how risk exposure can have a financial impact on your business • Make your business become more sustainable financially, socially and environmentally • Learn how to apply knowledge fast with this practical guide to risk management issues The sustainable approach covered by this book spans business survival to more recent issues, such as the use of energy and natural resources.

This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * Explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organization. * Examples of how risks are quantified and explanations of how risk exposure can have a real ‘material’ financial impact on an organization * Provides best practice examples along with case studies that demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organizations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally"

    annotation: "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job! You have made a complex subject highly accessible. It is very readable for anyone engaged in business whether in a small firm or a major corporation. - Peter Hutton, Managing Director of Brand Energy Research and formerly Group Development Director for MORI “Great concept: nicely executed and well written.

Brezhnev as a farmer, land-use surveyor, metallurgist, factory worker, and politician. Brezhnev underscores how he pushed for the organization of collective farms. The text also highlights the poor state of agriculture in the country, including the farming methodologies that Brezhnev and his countrymen have adopted to overcome the extreme conditions of farming lands. The manuscript details the improvement of state farms, particularly noting the increase in harvest and the number of farms to be set up. Brezhnev narrates how the state farms are affected by drought and extreme weather conditions, and how they have doubled the crop areas through the use of farm implements. The book also underscores the role of farm machineries in the increase of production of grain, meat, and vegetables. The text is a dependable source of data for readers interested in the life and career of L. I. Brezhnev, particularly his dedication to develop agriculture in Kazakhstan."

It is the first of an annual book mini-series surveying issues in this critical and rapidly changing area. These changes affect the health, safety, and well-being of literally billions of consumers, their governments, and the corporations involved in the prodigious task of not only creating novel, effective and safe products, but also complying with regulations, that vary from country to country. This book begins with a discussion of the risks assessment of cosmetic products. This is followed by separate chapters on the regulatory system in some of the major export markets of Canada and Australasia; the evolution and purpose of the EU's REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization of Chemicals); the issue of cosmetic toxicity; and regulatory requirements and warnings for cosmetic products. Subsequent chapters cover the challenges of global chemical compliance; the development of nanotechnology-based products and their potential impact on human health and the environment; and the various packaging regulations relating to colors and additives for products marketed in North America, the EU, and Asia."

    annotation: "This book is the definitive guide on the OSSEC Host-based Intrusion Detection system and frankly, to really use OSSEC you are going to need a definitive guide. Documentation has been available since the start of the OSSEC project but, due to time constraints, no formal book has been created to outline the various features and functions of the OSSEC product. This has left very important and powerful features of the product undocumented...until now! The book you are holding will show you how to install and configure OSSEC on the operating system of your choice and provide detailed examples to help prevent and mitigate attacks on your systems. -- Stephen Northcutt OSSEC determines if a host has been compromised in this manner by taking the equivalent of a picture of the host machine in its original, unaltered state. This \"picture\" captures the most relevant information about that machine's configuration. OSSEC saves this \"picture\" and then constantly compares it to the current state of that machine to identify anything that may have changed from the original configuration. Now, many of these changes are necessary, harmless, and authorized, such as a system administrator installing a new software upgrade, patch, or application. But, then there are the not-so-harmless changes, like the installation of a rootkit, trojan horse, or virus. Differentiating between the harmless and the not-so-harmless changes determines whether the system administrator or security professional is managing a secure, efficient network or a compromised network which might be funneling credit card numbers out to phishing gangs or storing massive amounts of pornography creating significant liability for that organization. Separating the wheat from the chaff is by no means an easy task. Hence the need for this book. The book is co-authored by Daniel Cid, who is the founder and lead developer of the freely available OSSEC host-based IDS. As such, readers can be certain they are reading the most accurate, timely, and insightful information on OSSEC. * Nominee for Best Book Bejtlich read in 2008! * http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/best-book-bejtlich-read-in-2008.html • Get Started with OSSEC Get an overview of the features of OSSEC including commonly used terminology, pre-install preparation, and deployment considerations. • Follow Steb-by-Step Installation Instructions Walk through the installation process for the \"local , “agent , and \"server\" install types on some of the most popular operating systems available. • Master Configuration Learn the basic configuration options for your install type and learn how to monitor log files, receive remote messages, configure email notification, and configure alert levels. • Work With Rules Extract key information from logs using decoders and how you can leverage rules to alert you of strange occurrences on your network. • Understand System Integrity Check and Rootkit Detection Monitor binary executable files, system configuration files, and the Microsoft Windows registry. • Configure Active Response Configure the active response actions you want and bind the actions to specific rules and sequence of events. • Use the OSSEC Web User Interface Install, configure, and use the community-developed, open source web interface available for OSSEC. • Play in the OSSEC VMware Environment Sandbox • Dig Deep into Data Log Mining Take the “high art of log analysis to the next level by breaking the dependence on the lists of strings or patterns to look for in the logs."

Concepts and tactics are presented categorically so that even when a specifically detailed vulnerability has been patched, the foundational information provided will help hackers in writing a newer, better attack; or help pen testers, auditors, and the like develop a more concrete design and defensive structure. The book is organized into four parts. Part I introduces the kernel and sets out the theoretical basis on which to build the rest of the book. Part II focuses on different operating systems and describes exploits for them that target various bug classes. Part III on remote kernel exploitation analyzes the effects of the remote scenario and presents new techniques to target remote issues. It includes a step-by-step analysis of the development of a reliable, one-shot, remote exploit for a real vulnerabilitya bug affecting the SCTP subsystem found in the Linux kernel. Finally, Part IV wraps up the analysis on kernel exploitation and looks at what the future may hold. Covers a range of operating system families — UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, Windows Details common scenarios such as generic memory corruption (stack overflow, heap overflow, etc.) issues, logical bugs and race conditions Delivers the reader from user-land exploitation to the world of kernel-land (OS) exploits/attacks, with a particular focus on the steps that lead to the creation of successful techniques, in order to give to the reader something more than just a set of tricks"

    annotation: "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds."

Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment."

Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment."

    annotation: "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job! You have made a complex subject highly accessible. It is very readable for anyone engaged in business whether in a small firm or a major corporation. - Peter Hutton, Managing Director of Brand Energy Research and formerly Group Development Director for MORI “Great concept: nicely executed and well written.

    annotation: "A Guide to Kernel Exploitation: Attacking the Core discusses the theoretical techniques and approaches needed to develop reliable and effective kernel-level exploits, and applies them to different operating systems, namely, UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, and Windows. Concepts and tactics are presented categorically so that even when a specifically detailed vulnerability has been patched, the foundational information provided will help hackers in writing a newer, better attack; or help pen testers, auditors, and the like develop a more concrete design and defensive structure. The book is organized into four parts. Part I introduces the kernel and sets out the theoretical basis on which to build the rest of the book. Part II focuses on different operating systems and describes exploits for them that target various bug classes. Part III on remote kernel exploitation analyzes the effects of the remote scenario and presents new techniques to target remote issues. It includes a step-by-step analysis of the development of a reliable, one-shot, remote exploit for a real vulnerabilitya bug affecting the SCTP subsystem found in the Linux kernel. Finally, Part IV wraps up the analysis on kernel exploitation and looks at what the future may hold. Covers a range of operating system families — UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, Windows Details common scenarios such as generic memory corruption (stack overflow, heap overflow, etc.) issues, logical bugs and race conditions Delivers the reader from user-land exploitation to the world of kernel-land (OS) exploits/attacks, with a particular focus on the steps that lead to the creation of successful techniques, in order to give to the reader something more than just a set of tricks"

    annotation: "It is now seen as essential that all businesses assess their exposure to business risk especially in relation to value creation. This book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact it has on the value of your business. It offers vital, accessible and timely tools to assist you in making an immediate difference to the core value of your business and thereby satisfy the demands of an ever increasing range of stakeholders. This book will help you: • Discover how risk exposure can have a financial impact on your business • Make your business become more sustainable financially, socially and environmentally • Learn how to apply knowledge fast with this practical guide to risk management issues The sustainable approach covered by this book spans business survival to more recent issues, such as the use of energy and natural resources. It highlights the value of a more enlightened approach throughout an organization. In doing so the book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact on value using the Sustainable and Economic Risk Management (SERM) methodology which considers: • inherent risk • management of risk • residual risk exposure. By exploring the various frameworks that organizations operate in today – whether compulsory, compliance driven, voluntary or motivated by best practice – the book offers a practical tool through the SERM model which is at the heart of the book’s approach to risk management. This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * Explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organization. * Examples of how risks are quantified and explanations of how risk exposure can have a real ‘material’ financial impact on an organization * Provides best practice examples along with case studies that demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organizations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally"

    annotation: "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds."

Companies regularly reshape themselves continually exploring new markets and developing new products. When they can't expand into new markets or develop new products on their own, they seek alternatives. These alternatives include merging with or acquiring other companies to create a single more capable company. Companies acquire other companies for a wide variety of reasons. In some cases company survival may actually be the reason. What does this condition mean to the security professional? In the course of mergers and acquisitions, security plays a vital role in helping to make the endeavor successful. There are numerous titles on the business aspects of M&A such as the ones listed below. However, this unique book focuses on the role security plays in helping to make a merger, acquisition or divestiture successful. It addresses the fundamental security elements that are required to support the effort.

Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment."

Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment."

In doing so the book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact on value using the Sustainable and Economic Risk Management (SERM) methodology which considers: • inherent risk • management of risk • residual risk exposure. By exploring the various frameworks that organizations operate in today – whether compulsory, compliance driven, voluntary or motivated by best practice – the book offers a practical tool through the SERM model which is at the heart of the book’s approach to risk management. This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * Explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organization. * Examples of how risks are quantified and explanations of how risk exposure can have a real ‘material’ financial impact on an organization * Provides best practice examples along with case studies that demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organizations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally"

    annotation: "Driven by the year-2000 problem, the hordes of COBOL developers experienced a renaissance, but the times when COBOL was state-of-the-art are long gone. Object-orientation, application servers, web front-ends, and relational database systems dominate the scene for new projects today. The fact remains however, that millions of lines of source code written in the structured programming language COBOL work daily on computer systems all over the world. One problem that COBOL developers have to deal with on these new projects is familiarity with object-oriented concepts. Markus Knasmüller, rich with experiences of OO projects in COBOL development teams, offers a successful introduction for the experienced COBOL programmer.

    annotation: "Ashley Friedlein's first book, Web Project Management: Delivering Successful Commercial Web Sites, became a bestseller and an essential reference for Web professionals developing new sites. Maintaining and Evolving Successful Commercial Web Sites addresses the realities of successful sites today, namely the notion that maintaining and evolving a site is actually a bigger commitment than launching it. Management wants to maximize returns and obtain reliable performance data, customers demand better service and insist on sites that are more advanced yet easier to use, and the Web site must increasingly be integrated with the entire business even as the amount of information it handles continues to grow. Maintaining and Evolving Successful Commercial Web Sites focuses more on process, reality, and pragmatism and less on strategic theory. It provides the reader with the knowledge, tools, approaches, and processes to manage key site maintenance and evolution projects, providing answers to the following questions: *How can I better manage changes and updates to the Web site? *How can I scale up to allow more contributions to the site and more content and still maintain quality and control? *What is content management and how do I go about it? *How do I go about personalization or community building? *What is Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and how do I actually do it online? *How do I measure and report on how well the site is doing? *How do I avoid information overload? *How do I maximize the value the site creates? The book includes case studies to demonstrate candidly how the issues discussed in the book translate into reality. *Case studies show candidly how the issues discussed translate into reality. *Describes content management & Customer Relationship Management (CRM) how to go about implementing them. *Teaches how to measure & report on how well the site is doing, how to avoid information overload, & how to maximize the value the site creates."

    annotation: "User passwords are the keys to the network kingdom, yet most users choose overly simplistic passwords (like password) that anyone could guess, while system administrators demand impossible to remember passwords littered with obscure characters and random numerals. Every computer user must face the problems of password security. According to a recent British study, passwords are usually obvious: around 50 percent of computer users select passwords based on names of a family member, spouse, partner, or a pet. Many users face the problem of selecting strong passwords that meet corporate security requirements. Too often, systems reject user-selected passwords because they are not long enough or otherwise do not meet complexity requirements. This book teaches users how to select passwords that always meet complexity requirements. A typical computer user must remember dozens of passwords and they are told to make them all unique and never write them down. For most users, the solution is easy passwords that follow simple patterns. This book teaches users how to select strong passwords they can easily remember. * Examines the password problem from the perspective of the administrator trying to secure their network * Author Mark Burnett has accumulated and analyzed over 1,000,000 user passwords and through his research has discovered what works, what doesn't work, and how many people probably have dogs named Spot * Throughout the book, Burnett sprinkles interesting and humorous password ranging from the Top 20 dog names to the number of references to the King James Bible in passwords"
