    "description": "Changing the Indian Economy: Renewal, Reform and Revival explores the fact that post-Modi India is witnessing unprecedented socioeconomic change, truly labeled as Modiâ€™s Mantra and his attempts to morph the Indian economic landscape. India is using an intelligent economic process for its renewal and growth, however, in a recent study by Nomura, 2016, The Japanese Financial Services firm, it is reported that there is downside risk to Indiaâ€™s baseline forecast of 7.8 per cent GDP growth in 2016. Although the report suggests that there was a mid-cycle consolidation in mid-2014, the recovery seems to be losing momentum. This book offers a novel, but inclusive outlook to the entire post-Modi economic overhaul. Offers a comprehensive narrative of the current economic scene in India Explores how the measures for reform are intelligent, while also considering their weaknesses Shows how India has a strong potential to grow amidst diversity of economic reforms and changing governance Includes a compilation of insightful articles on Indian economic reform and future prospects",

    "description": "Seven Deadliest Network Attacks identifies seven classes of network attacks and discusses how the attack works, including tools to accomplish the attack, the risks of the attack, and how to defend against the attack. This book pinpoints the most dangerous hacks and exploits specific to networks, laying out the anatomy of these attacks including how to make your system more secure. You will discover the best ways to defend against these vicious hacks with step-by-step instruction and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable. The book consists of seven chapters that deal with the following attacks: denial of service; war dialing; penetration testing; protocol tunneling; spanning tree attacks; man-in-the-middle; and password replay. These attacks are not mutually exclusive and were chosen because they help illustrate different aspects of network security. The principles on which they rely are unlikely to vanish any time soon, and they allow for the possibility of gaining something of interest to the attacker, from money to high-value data. This book is intended to provide practical, usable information. However, the world of network security is evolving very rapidly, and the attack that works today may (hopefully) not work tomorrow. It is more important, then, to understand the principles on which the attacks and exploits are based in order to properly plan either a network attack or a network defense. Seven Deadliest Network Attacks will appeal to information security professionals of all levels, network admins, and recreational hackers. Knowledge is power, find out about the most dominant attacks currently waging war on computers and networks globally Discover the best ways to defend against these vicious attacks; step-by-step instruction shows you how Institute countermeasures, donâ€™t be caught defenseless again, and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable",

This book not only explains in detail what LEAP is and how to use it, but also provides LEAP case studies from sectors such as auto manufacturing and offshore engineering. The intensity of competition in the global manufacturing industry has increased dramatically in the past decade, presenting challenges and opportunities to new operators and traditional centers alike. Using the latest ICT developments effectively is increasingly important in order to meet demands for mass customization, sustainability, and improved productivity. To achieve these goals, the Linked Engineering and manufacturing Platform (LEAP) was developed as an integrated information system for manufacturing design. Discusses how LEAP creates a new data environment for all stakeholders in the manufacturing industry, which will improve customization, sustainability, and productivity Devises an interoperability system to gather and coordinate digital data from machines and systems across the manufacturing supply chain Provides standards for the Internet of Things Includes case study data from companies at the cutting edge of ICT in manufacturing such as SAP, Volkswagen, and UBITECH",

Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) is the leading security policy management platform that unifies and automates access control to proactively enforce role-based access to enterprise networks. In Practical Deployment of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), Andy Richter and Jeremy Wood share their expertise from dozens of real-world implementations of ISE and the methods they have used for optimizing ISE in a wide range of environments. ISE can be difficult, requiring a team of security and network professionals, with the knowledge of many different specialties. Practical Deployment of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) shows you how to deploy ISE with the necessary integration across multiple different technologies required to make ISE work like a system. Andy Richter and Jeremy Wood explain end-to-end how to make the system work in the real world, giving you the benefit of their ISE expertise, as well as all the required ancillary technologies and configurations to make ISE work.",

    "description": "Is emergency management education undoing an age-old tradition in the American Fire Service? Has the time arrived to educate emergency managers in college classrooms rather than in twenty years of tactical operations experience? Over one hundred forty-three (143) institutions of higher education are now offering certificate or degree programs in emergency management with no tactical operations experience required for admission. Resistance by veteran law enforcement officers and fire fighters may have to be overcome if we are to prepare emergency managers with required skill sets. Dr. Tom Phelan explores the skills being taught to emergency management students and addresses the concerns of experienced first responders in accepting their leadership. *Discusses the value of emergency management education in the post-9/11 world *Makes clear the need for educating emergency managers to prepare them for emergency manager leadership *Helps bridge the gap between emergency management and first responders *Should be required reading in every college emergency management curriculum *The book is clear, concise, and an \"easy read\"",

While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds.",

The book explains terminology used in a jargon free way, and sets out to give you a practical guide to establishing a robust, yet workable governance framework for your enterprise. The book also guides you through the process of dealing with the particular issues relating to listed companies, and to those with exposures in other countries which may bring other jurisdictions? governance requirements to bear. The book is intended to appeal to accountants who are not professionals in corporate governance matters. It therefore aims to give them a user-friendly manual/guide to the issues of which they need to be aware. A quick reference guide. In addition the book provides a valuable update on the evolution of the concept of governance, and where the international trends appear to be going. The author is a financial services and regulatory consultant. She is also Manager, Corporate Governance for an international life company, and also an examiner and moderator who lectures and writes extensively on a wide range of compliance and financial services matters. The book is organised into the following sections. Section 1: what is corporate governance? How has it evolved, and what are the emerging trends? Section 2: a practical guide to establishing and implementing a robust governance framework * covers the concept of Corporate Governance from the point of view of accountants and directors and what these groups need to be aware of * explains the sensible steps that should be taken to document and provide evidence of their compliance with the various legislation in place * provides accountants with a practical, user-friendly manual to the governance issues which they need to be aware of.",

    "description": "Virgin Lands: Two Years in Kazakhstan, 1954-5 focuses on the life, career, and experiences of L. I. Brezhnev when he stayed in Kazakhstan to push for the improvement of the agriculture sector of the country. The book first offers information on the experiences of L. I. Brezhnev as a farmer, land-use surveyor, metallurgist, factory worker, and politician. Brezhnev underscores how he pushed for the organization of collective farms. The text also highlights the poor state of agriculture in the country, including the farming methodologies that Brezhnev and his countrymen have adopted to overcome the extreme conditions of farming lands. The manuscript details the improvement of state farms, particularly noting the increase in harvest and the number of farms to be set up. Brezhnev narrates how the state farms are affected by drought and extreme weather conditions, and how they have doubled the crop areas through the use of farm implements. The book also underscores the role of farm machineries in the increase of production of grain, meat, and vegetables. The text is a dependable source of data for readers interested in the life and career of L. I. Brezhnev, particularly his dedication to develop agriculture in Kazakhstan.",

    "description": "There is considerably more skill in the IT and security communities than is reflected in the jobs people are able to attain. Most people's limiting factor in their ability to get better jobs is not technical skills or even the soft skills necessary to do well in a new job. It is that getting a job is a completely different skill set and one that most people only practice every few years. Job Reconnaissance: Using Hacking Skills to Win the Job Hunt Game explains the job hunting process, why the most commonly followed models fail and how to better approach the search. It covers the entire job hunt process from when to decide to leave your current job, research new possible job opportunities, targeting your new boss, controlling the job interview process and negotiating your new compensation and the departure from your current job. This is not a complete all-in-one job-hunting book. This book assumes that the reader is reasonably competent and has already heard most of the \"standard\" advice, but is having difficulty putting the advice into practice. The goal is to fill in the gaps of the other books and to help the readers use their technical skills to their advantage in a different context. The emphasis in Job Reconnaissance is for infosec and IT job seekers to leverage the same skills they use in penetration testing and recon toward job-hunting success. These skills include targeting, reconnaissance and profiling combined with a technical look at skills other career search books commonly miss. Covers the entire job hunt process from when to decide to leave your current job to the departure of your current job Suggests how to research new possible job opportunities Shows how to target your new boss, controlling the job interview process and negotiating your new compensation",
