    "description": "Is emergency management education undoing an age-old tradition in the American Fire Service? Has the time arrived to educate emergency managers in college classrooms rather than in twenty years of tactical operations experience? Over one hundred forty-three (143) institutions of higher education are now offering certificate or degree programs in emergency management with no tactical operations experience required for admission. Resistance by veteran law enforcement officers and fire fighters may have to be overcome if we are to prepare emergency managers with required skill sets. Dr. Tom Phelan explores the skills being taught to emergency management students and addresses the concerns of experienced first responders in accepting their leadership. *Discusses the value of emergency management education in the post-9/11 world *Makes clear the need for educating emergency managers to prepare them for emergency manager leadership *Helps bridge the gap between emergency management and first responders *Should be required reading in every college emergency management curriculum *The book is clear, concise, and an \"easy read\"",

    "description": "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds.",

    "description": "In reaction to the continually changing business climate companies develop many business strategies to increase their competitiveness and improve profitability. Companies regularly reshape themselves continually exploring new markets and developing new products. When they can't expand into new markets or develop new products on their own, they seek alternatives. These alternatives include merging with or acquiring other companies to create a single more capable company. Companies acquire other companies for a wide variety of reasons. In some cases company survival may actually be the reason. What does this condition mean to the security professional? In the course of mergers and acquisitions, security plays a vital role in helping to make the endeavor successful. There are numerous titles on the business aspects of M&A such as the ones listed below. However, this unique book focuses on the role security plays in helping to make a merger, acquisition or divestiture successful. It addresses the fundamental security elements that are required to support the effort. In addition, it provides an integrated \"how to\" approach to implementing M&A security complete with methods and processes that have been quickly and cost-effectively implemented. - First book available that focuses on the role of the Security Manager in M&A - Case studies that highlight the role of the security manager; cases include both best practices as well as illustrations of nightmare examples of what NOT to do - Lead author is an expert that has participated in/managed security for more than 20 high-profile and large-scale acquisitions - Model processes, procedures, checklists, charts and sample forms all serve to ease immediate analysis and implementation in a merger or acquisition",

    "description": "Now in its 20th edition, \"Advances in Accounting\" continues to provide an important forum for discourse among and between academic and practicing accountants on issues of significance to the future of the discipline. Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment.",

Case studies are an effective method of learning the methods and processes that were both successful and unsuccessful in real cases. Using a variety of case types, including civil and criminal cases, with different cybercrimes, a broad base of knowledge can be gained by comparing the cases against each other. The primary goal of reviewing successful cases involving suspects using technology to facilitate crimes is to be able to find and use the same methods in future cases. This \"first look\" teaches you how to place the suspect behind the keyboard using case studies.",

Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment.",

    "description": "It is now seen as essential that all businesses assess their exposure to business risk especially in relation to value creation. This book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact it has on the value of your business. It offers vital, accessible and timely tools to assist you in making an immediate difference to the core value of your business and thereby satisfy the demands of an ever increasing range of stakeholders. This book will help you: • Discover how risk exposure can have a financial impact on your business • Make your business become more sustainable financially, socially and environmentally • Learn how to apply knowledge fast with this practical guide to risk management issues The sustainable approach covered by this book spans business survival to more recent issues, such as the use of energy and natural resources. It highlights the value of a more enlightened approach throughout an organization. In doing so the book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact on value using the Sustainable and Economic Risk Management (SERM) methodology which considers: • inherent risk • management of risk • residual risk exposure. By exploring the various frameworks that organizations operate in today – whether compulsory, compliance driven, voluntary or motivated by best practice – the book offers a practical tool through the SERM model which is at the heart of the book’s approach to risk management. This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * Explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organization. * Examples of how risks are quantified and explanations of how risk exposure can have a real ‘material’ financial impact on an organization * Provides best practice examples along with case studies that demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organizations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally",

    "description": "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job! You have made a complex subject highly accessible. It is very readable for anyone engaged in business whether in a small firm or a major corporation. - Peter Hutton, Managing Director of Brand Energy Research and formerly Group Development Director for MORI “Great concept: nicely executed and well written. Financial Ratios has a logical structure and flows well – I really enjoyed reading it and couldn’t put it down! - Dr David Hillson FRSA FAPM FIRM FCMI, Director of Risk Doctor and Partners. * Financial ratios can add value to any business - understand how * Do you your customers need to understand what the finance department is telling them and what they should do about it? * Understand the strengths and shortcomings of financial ratios which will help you grow and manage your business * Accompanying CD enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises",

    "description": "Insecure transportation systems are costing our worldwide mobility-based economy as much as 6% of GDP annually. The effectiveness of security measures vary widely. In the United States, depending on the mode of transportation, it ranges from “medium effectiveness for airports to “low effectiveness for maritime, rail, transit, and intermodal activities. Situational awareness and interoperability are lacking as we try to deal with both natural and man-made disasters. Regardless of the transport mode, improvements are essential if governments and corporations are to address security planning, response, and national preparedness. Transportation Security examines this problem in a comprehensive manner and addresses security-based technologies and solutions to minimize risk. * Covers air, sea, roadway, rail and public transport modes * Offers technological solutions for mobility based problems in planning, logistics and policy to improve security, combat terrorism and ensure national preparedness * Includes work of international experts & global examples related to transportation security",

    "description": "Virgin Lands: Two Years in Kazakhstan, 1954-5 focuses on the life, career, and experiences of L. I. Brezhnev when he stayed in Kazakhstan to push for the improvement of the agriculture sector of the country. The book first offers information on the experiences of L. I. Brezhnev as a farmer, land-use surveyor, metallurgist, factory worker, and politician. Brezhnev underscores how he pushed for the organization of collective farms. The text also highlights the poor state of agriculture in the country, including the farming methodologies that Brezhnev and his countrymen have adopted to overcome the extreme conditions of farming lands. The manuscript details the improvement of state farms, particularly noting the increase in harvest and the number of farms to be set up. Brezhnev narrates how the state farms are affected by drought and extreme weather conditions, and how they have doubled the crop areas through the use of farm implements. The book also underscores the role of farm machineries in the increase of production of grain, meat, and vegetables. The text is a dependable source of data for readers interested in the life and career of L. I. Brezhnev, particularly his dedication to develop agriculture in Kazakhstan.",

    "description": "Motor Disturbances II contains a selection of papers presented at the 2nd Congress of the International Medical Society of Motor Disturbances held in Rome, Italy, on June 2-4, 1988. Contributors focus on topics related to motor disturbances ranging from bradykinesia and akinesia to cranial movement disorders, weakness and the involvement of upper motor neurons in motor disturbances, and techniques such as neuroimaging and cortical stimulation. Organized into six sections comprised of 37 chapters, this compilation begins with an overview of the physiological aspects of electrical and magnetic stimulation of the human brain. It then discusses the PET scanning in Parkinson's disease (PD), levodopa and lisuride intravenous infusions in fluctuating Parkinsonian patients, and temporal discrimination and bradykinesia in PD patients. It explains the pathophysiological aspects of cranial movement disorders, the pathophysiology of weakness and the upper motoneuron syndrome, body sway in patients with hemiparesis, and spinal reflexes and central programming in spastic paresis during stance and gait. The book concludes with an analysis of motor disturbances in musicians. This book will appeal to neurologists, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, medical practitioners, clinical researchers, and anyone interested in motor disturbances.",

    "description": "Global Regulatory Issues for the Cosmetics Industry, Volume 1, emerged from the first annual Cosmetic Regulatory Forum organized by Health and Beauty America (HBA) in September 2006. It is the first of an annual book mini-series surveying issues in this critical and rapidly changing area. These changes affect the health, safety, and well-being of literally billions of consumers, their governments, and the corporations involved in the prodigious task of not only creating novel, effective and safe products, but also complying with regulations, that vary from country to country. This book begins with a discussion of the risks assessment of cosmetic products. This is followed by separate chapters on the regulatory system in some of the major export markets of Canada and Australasia; the evolution and purpose of the EU's REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization of Chemicals); the issue of cosmetic toxicity; and regulatory requirements and warnings for cosmetic products. Subsequent chapters cover the challenges of global chemical compliance; the development of nanotechnology-based products and their potential impact on human health and the environment; and the various packaging regulations relating to colors and additives for products marketed in North America, the EU, and Asia.",

Some of the topics and thoughts discussed here are as new as tomorrow’s headlines, whereas others have been around for decades without being properly addressed. I hope you enjoy this book as much as we have enjoyed working with the various authors and friends during its development. —Donald Withers, CEO and Cofounder of TheTrainingCo. • Jack Wiles, on Social Engineering offers up a potpourri of tips, tricks, vulnerabilities, and lessons learned from 30-plus years of experience in the worlds of both physical and technical security. • Russ Rogers on the Basics of Penetration Testing illustrates the standard methodology for penetration testing: information gathering, network enumeration, vulnerability identification, vulnerability exploitation, privilege escalation, expansion of reach, future access, and information compromise. • Johnny Long on No Tech Hacking shows how to hack without touching a computer using tailgating, lock bumping, shoulder surfing, and dumpster diving. • Phil Drake on Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness covers the basics of creating a plan for you and your family, identifying and obtaining the supplies you will need in an emergency. • Kevin O’Shea on Seizure of Digital Information discusses collecting hardware and information from the scene. • Amber Schroader on Cell Phone Forensics writes on new methods and guidelines for digital forensics. • Dennis O’Brien on RFID: An Introduction, Security Issues, and Concerns discusses how this well-intended technology has been eroded and used for fringe implementations. • Ron Green on Open Source Intelligence details how a good Open Source Intelligence program can help you create leverage in negotiations, enable smart decisions regarding the selection of goods and services, and help avoid pitfalls and hazards. • Raymond Blackwood on Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users maintains it is the technologist’s responsibility to educate, communicate, and support users despite their lack of interest in understanding how it works. • Greg Kipper on What is Steganography? provides a solid understanding of the basics of steganography, what it can and can’t do, and arms you with the information you need to set your career path. • Eric Cole on Insider Threat discusses why the insider threat is worse than the external threat and the effects of insider threats on a company.

    "description": "A cross site scripting attack is a very specific type of attack on a web application. It is used by hackers to mimic real sites and fool people into providing personal data. XSS Attacks starts by defining the terms and laying out the ground work. It assumes that the reader is familiar with basic web programming (HTML) and JavaScript. First it discusses the concepts, methodology, and technology that makes XSS a valid concern. It then moves into the various types of XSS attacks, how they are implemented, used, and abused. After XSS is thoroughly explored, the next part provides examples of XSS malware and demonstrates real cases where XSS is a dangerous risk that exposes internet users to remote access, sensitive data theft, and monetary losses. Finally, the book closes by examining the ways developers can avoid XSS vulnerabilities in their web applications, and how users can avoid becoming a victim. The audience is web developers, security practitioners, and managers. XSS Vulnerabilities exist in 8 out of 10 Web sites The authors of this book are the undisputed industry leading authorities Contains independent, bleeding edge research, code listings and exploits that can not be found anywhere else",

    "description": "This book is the definitive guide on the OSSEC Host-based Intrusion Detection system and frankly, to really use OSSEC you are going to need a definitive guide. Documentation has been available since the start of the OSSEC project but, due to time constraints, no formal book has been created to outline the various features and functions of the OSSEC product. This has left very important and powerful features of the product undocumented...until now! The book you are holding will show you how to install and configure OSSEC on the operating system of your choice and provide detailed examples to help prevent and mitigate attacks on your systems. -- Stephen Northcutt OSSEC determines if a host has been compromised in this manner by taking the equivalent of a picture of the host machine in its original, unaltered state. This \"picture\" captures the most relevant information about that machine's configuration. OSSEC saves this \"picture\" and then constantly compares it to the current state of that machine to identify anything that may have changed from the original configuration. Now, many of these changes are necessary, harmless, and authorized, such as a system administrator installing a new software upgrade, patch, or application. But, then there are the not-so-harmless changes, like the installation of a rootkit, trojan horse, or virus. Differentiating between the harmless and the not-so-harmless changes determines whether the system administrator or security professional is managing a secure, efficient network or a compromised network which might be funneling credit card numbers out to phishing gangs or storing massive amounts of pornography creating significant liability for that organization. Separating the wheat from the chaff is by no means an easy task. Hence the need for this book. The book is co-authored by Daniel Cid, who is the founder and lead developer of the freely available OSSEC host-based IDS. As such, readers can be certain they are reading the most accurate, timely, and insightful information on OSSEC. * Nominee for Best Book Bejtlich read in 2008! * http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/best-book-bejtlich-read-in-2008.html • Get Started with OSSEC Get an overview of the features of OSSEC including commonly used terminology, pre-install preparation, and deployment considerations. • Follow Steb-by-Step Installation Instructions Walk through the installation process for the \"local , “agent , and \"server\" install types on some of the most popular operating systems available. • Master Configuration Learn the basic configuration options for your install type and learn how to monitor log files, receive remote messages, configure email notification, and configure alert levels. • Work With Rules Extract key information from logs using decoders and how you can leverage rules to alert you of strange occurrences on your network. • Understand System Integrity Check and Rootkit Detection Monitor binary executable files, system configuration files, and the Microsoft Windows registry. • Configure Active Response Configure the active response actions you want and bind the actions to specific rules and sequence of events. • Use the OSSEC Web User Interface Install, configure, and use the community-developed, open source web interface available for OSSEC. • Play in the OSSEC VMware Environment Sandbox • Dig Deep into Data Log Mining Take the “high art of log analysis to the next level by breaking the dependence on the lists of strings or patterns to look for in the logs.",

    "description": "A Guide to Kernel Exploitation: Attacking the Core discusses the theoretical techniques and approaches needed to develop reliable and effective kernel-level exploits, and applies them to different operating systems, namely, UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, and Windows. Concepts and tactics are presented categorically so that even when a specifically detailed vulnerability has been patched, the foundational information provided will help hackers in writing a newer, better attack; or help pen testers, auditors, and the like develop a more concrete design and defensive structure. The book is organized into four parts. Part I introduces the kernel and sets out the theoretical basis on which to build the rest of the book. Part II focuses on different operating systems and describes exploits for them that target various bug classes. Part III on remote kernel exploitation analyzes the effects of the remote scenario and presents new techniques to target remote issues. It includes a step-by-step analysis of the development of a reliable, one-shot, remote exploit for a real vulnerabilitya bug affecting the SCTP subsystem found in the Linux kernel. Finally, Part IV wraps up the analysis on kernel exploitation and looks at what the future may hold. Covers a range of operating system families — UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, Windows Details common scenarios such as generic memory corruption (stack overflow, heap overflow, etc.) issues, logical bugs and race conditions Delivers the reader from user-land exploitation to the world of kernel-land (OS) exploits/attacks, with a particular focus on the steps that lead to the creation of successful techniques, in order to give to the reader something more than just a set of tricks",

    "description": "Driven by the year-2000 problem, the hordes of COBOL developers experienced a renaissance, but the times when COBOL was state-of-the-art are long gone. Object-orientation, application servers, web front-ends, and relational database systems dominate the scene for new projects today. The fact remains however, that millions of lines of source code written in the structured programming language COBOL work daily on computer systems all over the world. One problem that COBOL developers have to deal with on these new projects is familiarity with object-oriented concepts. Markus Knasmüller, rich with experiences of OO projects in COBOL development teams, offers a successful introduction for the experienced COBOL programmer. A careful approach across techniques familiar to COBOL developers and discussions of current standards make this book easily accessible and understandable. *A practical approach to OOP using the concepts and techniques familiar to the experienced COBOL programmer. *Written independently from any specific programming environment, and all programming examples written in both Delphi and Java. *Detailed case study describing the successful migration of 10 million lines of COBOL code to object-oriented programming. *Companion CD-ROM containing all tutorial sections of the book in PowerPoint and all sample solutions to the problems ready for compilation.",

    "description": "Disappearing Cryptography, Second Edition describes how to take words, sounds, or images and hide them in digital data so they look like other words, sounds, or images. When used properly, this powerful technique makes it almost impossible to trace the author and the recipient of a message. Conversations can be submerged in the flow of information through the Internet so that no one can know if a conversation exists at all. This full revision of the best-selling first edition describes a number of different techniques to hide information. These include encryption, making data incomprehensible; steganography, embedding information into video, audio, or graphics files; watermarking, hiding data in the noise of image or sound files; mimicry, \"dressing up\" data and making it appear to be other data, and more. The second edition also includes an expanded discussion on hiding information with spread-spectrum algorithms, shuffling tricks, and synthetic worlds. Each chapter is divided into sections, first providing an introduction and high-level summary for those who want to understand the concepts without wading through technical explanations, and then presenting greater detail for those who want to write their own programs. To encourage exploration, the author's Web site www.wayner.org/books/discrypt2/ contains implementations for hiding information in lists, sentences, and images. Each chapter is divided into sections, providing first an introduction and high-level summary for those who want to understand the concepts without wading through technical details, and then an introductory set of details, for those who want to write their own programs. Fully revised and expanded. Covers key concepts for non-technical readers. Goes into technical details for those wanting to create their own programs and implement algorithms.",

    "description": "Don't Just Do Something, Sit There offers anyone who would like to learn how to coach or to develop their existing coaching skills a practical guide to coaching people using a predominantly non-directive approach. It explores how a coach can help others to think through their situation and find their own way forward, one which reflects the reality and constraints of their situation. The book considers the skills which underpin successful coaching – listening attentively, asking questions that help the other to think, and playing back to communicate or check understanding. It explores the spectrum of directive to non-directive coaching, considers practical aspects such as confidentiality, describes a range of tools that a coach might use, and looks at how a line manager can adopt a coaching style. It also considers the philosophical and psychological foundations of non-directive coaching. Written by an experienced coach in clear and easily understood language Aimed at managers, consultants and HR professionals who want to use a non-directive approach to empowering others and releasing their potential Chapters can be read as stand alone guides to topics such as listening, questioning, becoming a capable coach, and the inner game of coaching",

It thus provides those seeking to do business in Vietnam with an unparalleled insight into how and why its businesses in general, and state owned enterprises in particular, are structured and managed, a topic about which little has been previously written. The book also presents researchers and students with a comprehensive, societal approach to the study of organisational behaviour, and offers a distinctive interpretation of the common problems of state owned enterprises in transitional economies that goes beyond the traditional economic explanation. Is written by a Vietnamese academic whose unique access gave him an in-depth knowledge and understanding of business practices in Vietnam Provides information on the business environment in Vietnam Provides a comprehensive and innovative explanation and interpretation of the business system in Vietnam based on real world case studies and observations",

    "description": "Homeland Security: The Essentials expertly delineates the bedrock principles of preparing for, mitigating, managing, and recovering from emergencies and disasters. Taking as its starting point the content included in Introduction to Homeland Security, Fourth Edition, by the same author team, this new textbook lays a solid foundation for the study of present and future threats to our communities and to national security, and challenges readers to imagine more effective ways to manage these risks. This concise version outlines the risks facing the US today and the structures we have put in place to deal with them. From cyber warfare to devastating tornados to car bombs, all hazards currently fall within the purview of the Department of Homeland Security. Yet the federal role must be closely aligned with the work of partners in the private sector. This book examines the challenges involved in these collaborative efforts. It retains the previous version's ample full-color illustrations, but in a streamlined and more affordable paperback format. A companion website offers material for student use, and the instructor-support web site includes an online Instructor’s Guide (complete with chapter summaries and a test bank containing multiple-choice, true-or-false questions, and essay questions); PowerPoint Lecture Slides and Interactive Video; and other new case-study material created for this text. The BH Learning Library offers support for teaching your students the key skills of critical thinking, writing, and research. This book will appeal to students in Homeland Security and government/modern history programs; government officials and national policy-makers; private security and risk assessment professionals; professionals involved in state, federal, and private security training programs; and emergency management personnel. Highlights and expands on key content from the bestselling textbook Introduction to Homeland Security, 4th Edition Concisely delineates the bedrock principles of preparing for, mitigating, managing, and recovering from emergencies and disasters Instructor materials include Learning Library modules to support writing, critical thinking, and research skills Instructor websites offer valuable material for expanding the curriculum, including an Instructor's Guide, test banks, PPT Lecture Slides, and Interactive Video",

There are also many different techniques for establishing efficient transfer pricing systems within an organisation. This illuminating handbook provides a thorough introduction to transfer pricing and its uses within financial organisations, as well as a clear analysis of all the issues involved. Transfer pricing is so complex and variable that there can be no definitive blueprint for success: however, in this book John Smullen has provided a vital contribution to the debate and a much-needed clarification of this important topic. Some of the areas covered: What transfer pricing is and why it is used Why transfer prices are so appropriate for financial institutions Why each organisation needs to approach the introduction of transfer prices differently How transfer pricing works in commercial organisations The different types of transfer price Specific analysis of the transfer pricing of funds, capital and derivatives How to evaluate risk adjusted performance measures The complexities of estimating marginal costs and revenues A framework for understanding the motivation of shareholders, managers and regulators How transfer pricing works as part of management information strategy This lucid and authoritative handbook will help you to: Understand the different techniques used in transfer pricing Establish transfer prices in line with your organisation's strategy and objectives Make sound decisions, minimise risk and achieve better outcomes This is a book for people involved in raising and loaning funds in today's global markets who wants to understand the issues involved in transfer pricing and the techniques required. It will be used by banking, investment, insurance and other financial organisations worldwide. An authoritative and detailed survey of transfer pricing in the financial sector A clear exploration by an expert in the field A full description of the issues involved and the techniques required",

The business and marketing aspects of NPD, sometimes neglected in books of this type, are addressed alongside methods for product testing. Trends, processes and perspectives in consumer-driven NPD in the food and personal care product industries are addressed in the opening chapters of the book. Specific topics include evolution in food retailing and advances in concept research. Hedonic testing is the focus of the next section. Different viewpoints on consumer research methods and statistics for NPD are reviewed in later chapters. The final part of the book looks towards the future of innovation, covering the implications for NPD of topics such as human genetic variation in taste perception and neuroimaging. Several chapters are not standard scientific articles. Rather they are written records of conversations between two people on a particular topic related to consumer-driven innovation in foods and personal care products. In them the interviewees speak freely about their views and experiences in NPD, providing unique insights. Consumer-driven innovation in food and personal care products will broaden readers’ understanding of the many approaches available to NPD personnel and ways in which they can be used to support innovation activities.

Parts five and six review issues which are currently driving change in food supply chains: the effective use of new technologies and the desire to deliver food sustainably and responsibly. With expert contributions from leaders in their fields, Delivering performance in food supply chains will help practitioners and academics to understand different approaches in supply chain management, explore alternative methods and develop more effective systems. Considers the fundamental role of relationship management in supply chains including an overview of performance measurement in the management of food supply chains Discusses the alignment of supply and demand in food supply chains and reviews sales and operations planning and marketing strategies for competitive advantage in the food industry Provides an overview of the effective use of new technologies and those that will be used in the future to deliver food sustainably and reliably",

    "description": "The book is logically divided into 5 main categories with each category representing a major skill set required by most security professionals: 1. Coding – The ability to program and script is quickly becoming a mainstream requirement for just about everyone in the security industry. This section covers the basics in coding complemented with a slue of programming tips and tricks in C/C++, Java, Perl and NASL. 2. Sockets – The technology that allows programs and scripts to communicate over a network is sockets. Even though the theory remains the same – communication over TCP and UDP, sockets are implemented differently in nearly ever language. 3. Shellcode – Shellcode, commonly defined as bytecode converted from Assembly, is utilized to execute commands on remote systems via direct memory access. 4. Porting – Due to the differences between operating platforms and language implementations on those platforms, it is a common practice to modify an original body of code to work on a different platforms. This technique is known as porting and is incredible useful in the real world environments since it allows you to not “recreate the wheel. 5. Coding Tools – The culmination of the previous four sections, coding tools brings all of the techniques that you have learned to the forefront. With the background technologies and techniques you will now be able to code quick utilities that will not only make you more productive, they will arm you with an extremely valuable skill that will remain with you as long as you make the proper time and effort dedications. *Contains never before seen chapters on writing and automating exploits on windows systems with all-new exploits. *Perform zero-day exploit forensics by reverse engineering malicious code. *Provides working code and scripts in all of the most common programming languages for readers to use TODAY to defend their networks.",

This book begins with an overall explanation of information security, physical security, and why approaching these two different types of security in one way (called convergence) is so critical in today’s changing security landscape. It then details enterprise security management as it relates to incident detection and incident management. This is followed by detailed examples of implementation, taking the reader through cases addressing various physical security technologies such as: video surveillance, HVAC, RFID, access controls, biometrics, and more. This topic is picking up momentum every day with every new computer exploit, announcement of a malicious insider, or issues related to terrorists, organized crime, and nation-state threats The author has over a decade of real-world security and management expertise developed in some of the most sensitive and mission-critical environments in the world Enterprise Security Management (ESM) is deployed in tens of thousands of organizations worldwide",

    "description": "User passwords are the keys to the network kingdom, yet most users choose overly simplistic passwords (like password) that anyone could guess, while system administrators demand impossible to remember passwords littered with obscure characters and random numerals. Every computer user must face the problems of password security. According to a recent British study, passwords are usually obvious: around 50 percent of computer users select passwords based on names of a family member, spouse, partner, or a pet. Many users face the problem of selecting strong passwords that meet corporate security requirements. Too often, systems reject user-selected passwords because they are not long enough or otherwise do not meet complexity requirements. This book teaches users how to select passwords that always meet complexity requirements. A typical computer user must remember dozens of passwords and they are told to make them all unique and never write them down. For most users, the solution is easy passwords that follow simple patterns. This book teaches users how to select strong passwords they can easily remember. * Examines the password problem from the perspective of the administrator trying to secure their network * Author Mark Burnett has accumulated and analyzed over 1,000,000 user passwords and through his research has discovered what works, what doesn't work, and how many people probably have dogs named Spot * Throughout the book, Burnett sprinkles interesting and humorous password ranging from the Top 20 dog names to the number of references to the King James Bible in passwords",

    "description": "This book will take readers from the discovery of vulnerabilities and the creation of the corresponding exploits, through a complete security assessment, all the way through deploying patches against these vulnerabilities to protect their networks. This is unique in that it details both the management and technical skill and tools required to develop an effective vulnerability management system. Business case studies and real world vulnerabilities are used through the book. It starts by introducing the reader to the concepts of a vulnerability management system. Readers will be provided detailed timelines of exploit development, vendors’ time to patch, and corporate path installations. Next, the differences between security assessment s and penetration tests will be clearly explained along with best practices for conducting both. Next, several case studies from different industries will illustrate the effectiveness of varying vulnerability assessment methodologies. The next several chapters will define the steps of a vulnerability assessment including: defining objectives, identifying and classifying assets, defining rules of engagement, scanning hosts, and identifying operating systems and applications. The next several chapters provide detailed instructions and examples for differentiating vulnerabilities from configuration problems, validating vulnerabilities through penetration testing. The last section of the book provides best practices for vulnerability management and remediation. * Unique coverage detailing both the management and technical skill and tools required to develop an effective vulnerability management system * Vulnerability management is rated the #2 most pressing concern for security professionals in a poll conducted by Information Security Magazine * Covers in the detail the vulnerability management lifecycle from discovery through patch.",

For many years, the promise of high quality, low cost video conferencing has been an attractive solution for businesses interested in cutting travel costs while maintaining the benefits of face-to-face contact. Unfortunately, most solutions never lived up to the promise, due primarily to lack of internet bandwidth and poorly developed protocols. That's no all changed. The capacity has been created, the hardware works, and businesses are more eager than ever to cut down on travel costs. * Budget conscious methods for deploying Video over IP in small to medium enterprises * Coverage of Cisco, Microsoft, Skype, AOL, Google, VidiTel and many other products * How to identify and resolve nagging quality of service issues such as transmission delays and out of synch video-to-voice feeds",

Maintaining and Evolving Successful Commercial Web Sites addresses the realities of successful sites today, namely the notion that maintaining and evolving a site is actually a bigger commitment than launching it. Management wants to maximize returns and obtain reliable performance data, customers demand better service and insist on sites that are more advanced yet easier to use, and the Web site must increasingly be integrated with the entire business even as the amount of information it handles continues to grow. Maintaining and Evolving Successful Commercial Web Sites focuses more on process, reality, and pragmatism and less on strategic theory. It provides the reader with the knowledge, tools, approaches, and processes to manage key site maintenance and evolution projects, providing answers to the following questions: *How can I better manage changes and updates to the Web site? *How can I scale up to allow more contributions to the site and more content and still maintain quality and control? *What is content management and how do I go about it? *How do I go about personalization or community building? *What is Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and how do I actually do it online? *How do I measure and report on how well the site is doing? *How do I avoid information overload? *How do I maximize the value the site creates? The book includes case studies to demonstrate candidly how the issues discussed in the book translate into reality. *Case studies show candidly how the issues discussed translate into reality. *Describes content management & Customer Relationship Management (CRM) how to go about implementing them. *Teaches how to measure & report on how well the site is doing, how to avoid information overload, & how to maximize the value the site creates.",

Highly organized and sophisticated criminal entities are constantly developing more complex, obfuscated, and armored viruses, worms, Trojans, and botnets. IDA Pro’s interactive interface and programmable development language provide you with complete control over code disassembly and debugging. This is the only book which focuses exclusively on the world’s most powerful and popular took for reverse engineering code. *Reverse Engineer REAL Hostile Code To follow along with this chapter, you must download a file called !DANGER!INFECTEDMALWARE!DANGER!... ‘nuff said. *Portable Executable (PE) and Executable and Linking Formats (ELF) Understand the physical layout of PE and ELF files, and analyze the components that are essential to reverse engineering. *Break Hostile Code Armor and Write your own Exploits Understand execution flow, trace functions, recover hard coded passwords, find vulnerable functions, backtrace execution, and craft a buffer overflow. *Master Debugging Debug in IDA Pro, use a debugger while reverse engineering, perform heap and stack access modification, and use other debuggers. *Stop Anti-Reversing Anti-reversing, like reverse engineering or coding in assembly, is an art form. The trick of course is to try to stop the person reversing the application. Find out how! *Track a Protocol through a Binary and Recover its Message Structure Trace execution flow from a read event, determine the structure of a protocol, determine if the protocol has any undocumented messages, and use IDA Pro to determine the functions that process a particular message. *Develop IDA Scripts and Plug-ins Learn the basics of IDA scripting and syntax, and write IDC scripts and plug-ins to automate even the most complex tasks.",

    "description": "Agile Development and Business Goals: The Six-Week Solution is a guide for the software development process, which can be challenging, difficult, and time-consuming. This process, called the “Agile process, is unique, and it features several aspects that distinguish it from the classical methods of software development. The book offers readers information about the design, implementation, and management of the different methods of creating world-class software. The book discusses the various reasons that the development of software is a difficult process, and it addresses how software development sometimes fails and why it seldom aligns with business needs. It further examines the risk associated with software creation and the different ways to mitigate them. This book is relevant to software development managers responsible for creating quality software products, and managing software development teams. Explains how to employ automation in your development process to improve your company’s profitability Introduces a compensation structure that incents your technical talent to deliver measurable results on a predictable basis Provides real-world solutions – questions to ask when hiring or which build server software to consider, for example – instead of theoretical discussions",

    "description": "The Profit Impact of Business Intelligence presents an A-to-Z approach for getting the most business intelligence (BI) from a company's data assets or data warehouse. BI is not just a technology or methodology, it is a powerful new management approach that – when done right – can deliver knowledge, efficiency, better decisions, and profit to almost any organization that uses it. When BI first came on the scene, it promised a lot but often failed to deliver. The missing element was the business-centric focus explained in this book. It shows how you can achieve the promise of BI by connecting it to your organization’s strategic goals, culture, and strengths while correcting your BI weaknesses. It provides a practical, process-oriented guide to achieve the full promise of BI; shows how world-class companies used BI to become leaders in their industries; helps senior business and IT executives understand the strategic impact of BI and how they can ensure a strong payoff from their BI investments; and identifies the most common mistakes organizations make in implementing BI. The book also includes a helpful glossary of BI terms; a BI readiness assessment for your organization; and Web links and extensive references for more information. A practical, process-oriented book that will help organizations realize the promise of BI Written by Nancy and Steve Williams, veteran consultants and instructors with hands-on, \"in the trenches\" experience in government and corporate business intelligence applications Will help senior business and IT executives understand the strategic impact of BI and how they can help ensure a strong payoff on BI investments",

A crucial part of any hiring process should be employment background screening, pre- and post-hire, which gives hiring personnel a glimpse into a person's past behavior patterns, propensities, and likely future behavior. Background Screening and Investigations describes all aspects of the employment background screening processes - its history and evolution, the imperative for implementing a screening process, and the creation of a comprehensive policy. Nixon and Kerr show how security and human resources professionals can work together to negotiate legal hurdles and make their background screening process successful. * Where do HR and security perspectives differ on hot topics like hiring convicted felons, data protection, and sexual predators? * What does state law allow when screening job candidates? * How should companies deal with emerging issues like international background investigations and continuous (Infinity) screening of current employees?",

The APT bypasses most of an organization’s current security devices, and is typically carried out by an organized group, such as a foreign nation state or rogue group with both the capability and the intent to persistently and effectively target a specific entity and wreak havoc. Most organizations do not understand how to deal with it and what is needed to protect their network from compromise. In Advanced Persistent Threat: Understanding the Danger and How to Protect your Organization Eric Cole discusses the critical information that readers need to know about APT and how to avoid being a victim. Advanced Persistent Threat is the first comprehensive manual that discusses how attackers are breaking into systems and what to do to protect and defend against these intrusions. How and why organizations are being attacked How to develop a \"Risk based Approach to Security\" Tools for protecting data and preventing attacks Critical information on how to respond and recover from an intrusion The emerging threat to Cloud based networks",

    "description": "Nearly every business depends on its network to provide information services to carry out essential activities, and network intrusion attacks have been growing increasingly frequent and severe. When network intrusions do occur, it’s imperative that a thorough and systematic analysis and investigation of the attack is conducted to determine the nature of the threat and the extent of information lost, stolen, or damaged during the attack. A thorough and timely investigation and response can serve to minimize network downtime and ensure that critical business systems are maintained in full operation. Network Intrusion Analysis teaches the reader about the various tools and techniques to use during a network intrusion investigation. The book focuses on the methodology of an attack as well as the investigative methodology, challenges, and concerns. This is the first book that provides such a thorough analysis of network intrusion investigation and response. Network Intrusion Analysis addresses the entire process of investigating a network intrusion by: *Providing a step-by-step guide to the tools and techniques used in the analysis and investigation of a network intrusion. *Providing real-world examples of network intrusions, along with associated workarounds. *Walking you through the methodology and practical steps needed to conduct a thorough intrusion investigation and incident response, including a wealth of practical, hands-on tools for incident assessment and mitigation.

    "description": "Windows Server 2012 Security from End to Edge and Beyond shows you how to architect, design, plan, and deploy Microsoft security technologies for Windows 8/Server 2012 in the enterprise. The book covers security technologies that apply to both client and server and enables you to identify and deploy Windows 8 security features in your systems based on different business and deployment scenarios. The book is a single source for learning how to secure Windows 8 in many systems, including core, endpoint, and anywhere access. Authors Tom Shinder and Yuri Diogenes, both Microsoft employees, bring you insider knowledge of the Windows 8 platform, discussing how to deploy Windows security technologies effectively in both the traditional datacenter and in new cloud-based solutions. With this book, you will understand the conceptual underpinnings of Windows 8 security and how to deploy these features in a test lab and in pilot and production environments. The book's revolutionary \"Test Lab Guide\" approach lets you test every subject in a predefined test lab environment. This, combined with conceptual and deployment guidance, enables you to understand the technologies and move from lab to production faster than ever before. Critical material is also presented in key concepts and scenario-based approaches to evaluation, planning, deployment, and management. Videos illustrating the functionality in the Test Lab can be downloaded from the authors’ blog http://blogs.technet.com.b.security_talk/. Each chapter wraps up with a bullet list summary of key concepts discussed in the chapter. Provides practical examples of how to design and deploy a world-class security infrastructure to protect both Windows 8 and non-Microsoft assets on your system Written by two Microsoft employees who provide an inside look at the security features of Windows 8 Test Lab Guides enable you to test everything before deploying live to your system",

    "description": "Physiology of the Amphibia, Volume II focuses on the various aspects of amphibian reproduction, both physiological and behavioral, and the interrelationship between these mechanisms and the environment. Organized into five chapters, the book begins with the integrative functions of the amphibian brain. It then describes the cytophysiology of the amphibian adenohypophysis, as well as their reproductive organs and associated sexual structures. It also discusses the physiology of the process of yolk formation, vitellogenesis. The reproductive and courtship patterns and intersexuality among amphibians are also described. This book will be useful to general biologists as a reference source and to students with interests in animal physiology.",

    "description": "Management Accounting is part of the celebrations to mark CIMA’s 90th anniversary in 2009. It looks at the development of cost and management accounting from the founding of the Institute to today. It considers a number of immediate challenges to management accountants and surveys a range of issues and challenges that will likely affect management accounting thought and practice in the future. The authors examine the possibilities for accountants to widen their focus and become more familiar with the enterprise technology determining their organisations’ cost structures and with the effects of multiple production in various locations, such as economies or diseconomies of scale. Such change may require the alteration of traditional cost models used by accountants to become more nuanced. The book suggests how this may be accomplished and highlights the need for management accountants to work as part of management teams throughout the organisation as business partners rather than remain grounded in specialist information provision roles. Alnoor Bhimani is Professor of Management Accounting at the London School of Economics. He is also a Certified Management Accountant as well as an author of 15 books and over 100 articles. Michael Bromwich was CIMA’s Professor of Accounting and Financial Management at the London School of Economics and Political Science (1985 to 2006), now Emeritus. He is a Past President of CIMA (1987/88) and currently serves on CIMA’s Technical Committee. A unique survey of 90 years of CIMA research Analyses the research to determine future challenges for management accounting and business practices Charts the history of management accountancy and business practice over nearly 100 years",

    "description": "At the top of a company, sales do not matter, profits do not matter, even return on investment is a secondary concern. What matters is share price and what drives share price is the creation of shareholder value. Many marketing directors, obsessed with branding and other promotional tactics, miss this fundamental truth of modern business and so destroy the wealth of their company's ultimate owners. By failing to consider and manage the business risk associated with their strategies, they deliver returns below the cost of capital and neglect the firm's raison d'etre. The board needs a way of holding these marketers to account. Marketing Due Diligence is a new process which has emerged from years of research at Cranfield, one of Europe's leading business schools. It blends proven ideas from strategic and financial management with new concepts about organisational effectiveness to create a process that directly connects marketing strategy to shareholder value. CEOs and CFOs cannot afford to operate without Marketing Due Diligence. Bad marketing directors cannot afford to work with it. * Top level Cranfield based author team utilising latest Cranfield in-company research * Connects marketing plans and investment to the valuation of the firm and how it can contribute to increasing stakeholder value * Systematic and practical approach so that it can be used by both practitioners and students",

    "description": "Rethinking Risk and the Precautionary Principle challenges the claim that the precautionary principle is an appropriate guide to public policy decision-making in the face of uncertainty. The precautionary principle is frequently invoked as a justification for regulating human activities. From bans on the use of growth hormones in cattle to restrictions on children's playground activities, precautionary thinking seems to be taking over our lives. As the contributors to this book show, such an approach is of dubious utility and may even be counterproductive. This is a timely and important contribution to the debate on how to manage risk in the modern world. The editor, Julian Morris, is Director of the Environment and Technology Programme at the Institute of Economic Affairs in London. He has written widely on issues relating to environmental protection and technological development. Up to date discussion of current issues and scientific controversies Challenges the claim that the 'precautionary principle' is an appropriate guide to public policy decisions",

    "description": "Dividend Policy provides a comprehensive study of dividend policy. It explores the puzzle presented by dividends: irrational and subject to fashion, yet popular and desirable, they remain a priority among managers, even while perceived as largely symbolic. After exploring the history of dividend payments, from the emergence of the modern corporation to current perspectives, it traces the evolution of academic models on dividend policy. Here the authors review models of symmetric and asymmetric information before analyzing academia's accomplishments in solving the dividend puzzle. Related subjects, such as valuation and wealth distribution, round out the authors' presentation about new ways to think about one of the most intriguing subjects in financial economics. The book is recommended for professors and students in departments of finance and business, corporate finance staff, and financial regulators. The only comprehensive study of dividend policy Covers the historical evolution of dividends and academic research on dividend policy Presents new ways of thinking about dividends and dividend policy",

    "description": "Network Security is a comprehensive resource written for anyone who plans or implements network security measures, including managers and practitioners. It offers a valuable dual perspective on security: how your network looks to hackers who want to get inside, and how you need to approach it on the inside to keep them at bay. You get all the hands-on technical advice you need to succeed, but also higher-level administrative guidance for developing an effective security policy. There may be no such thing as absolute security, but, as the author clearly demonstrates, there is a huge difference between the protection offered by routine reliance on third-party products and what you can achieve by actively making informed decisions. You’ll learn to do just that with this book’s assessments of the risks, rewards, and trade-offs related implementing security measures. Helps you see through a hacker's eyes so you can make your network more secure. Provides technical advice that can be applied in any environment, on any platform, including help with intrusion detection systems, firewalls, encryption, anti-virus software, and digital certificates. Emphasizes a wide range of administrative considerations, including security policies, user management, and control of services and devices. Covers techniques for enhancing the physical security of your systems and network. Explains how hackers use information-gathering to find and exploit security flaws. Examines the most effective ways to prevent hackers from gaining root access to a server. Addresses Denial of Service attacks, \"malware,\" and spoofing. Includes appendices covering the TCP/IP protocol stack, well-known ports, and reliable sources for security warnings and updates.",

    "description": "Practical Airport Operations, Safety, and Emergency Management: Protocols for Today and the Future focuses on the airport itself, not the aircraft, manufacturers, designers, or even the pilots. The book explores the safety of what's been called ‘the most expensive piece of pavement in any city’— the facility that operates, maintains, and ensures the safety of millions of air passengers every year. The book is organized into three helpful sections, each focusing on one of the sectors described in the title. Section One: Airport Safety, explores the airport environment, then delves into safety management systems. Section Two: Airport Operations, continues the conversation on safety management systems before outlining airside and landside operations in depth, while Section Three: Airport Emergency Management, is a careful, detailed exploration of the topic, ending with a chapter on the operational challenges airport operations managers can expect to face in the future.

    "description": "In the digital world, the need to protect communications increases every day. While traditional digital encryption methods are useful, there are many other options for hiding your information. Information Hiding in Speech Signals for Secure Communication provides a number of methods to hide secret speech information using a variety of digital speech coding standards. Professor Zhijun Wu has conducted years of research in the field of speech information hiding, and brings his state-of-the-art techniques to readers of this book, including a mathematical model for information hiding, the core concepts of secure speech communication, the ABS-based information hiding algorithm, and much more. This book shows how to implement a secure speech communication system, including applications to various network security states. Readers will find information hiding algorithms and techniques (embedding and extracting) that are capable of withstanding the advanced forms of attack. The book presents concepts and applications for all of the most widely used speech coding standards, including G.711, G.721, G.728, G.729 and GSM, along with corresponding hiding and extraction algorithms. Readers will also learn how to use a speech covert communication system over an IP network as well as a speech secure communication system applied in PSTN. Presents information hiding theory and the mathematical model used for information hiding in speech. Provides a number of methods to hide secret speech information using the most common digital speech coding standards. A combination of practice and theory enables programmers and system designers not only to implement tried and true encryption procedures, but also to consider probable future developments in their designs.",

On the other hand, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is gaining popularity as a software delivery model through cloud platforms due to the many benefits to software vendors, as well as their customers. Multi-tenancy, which refers to the sharing of a single application instance across multiple customers or user groups (called tenants), is an essential characteristic of the SaaS model. Written in an easy to follow style with discussions supported by real-world examples, Service Orchestration as Organization introduces a novel approach with associated language, framework, and tool support to show how service orchestration techniques can be used to engineer and deploy SaaS applications. Describes the benefits as well as the challenges of building adaptive, multi-tenant software service applications using service-orchestration techniques Provides a thorough synopsis of the current state of the art, including the advantages and drawbacks of the adaptation techniques available Describes in detail how the underlying framework of the new approach has been implemented using available technologies, such as business rules engines and web services",

This book provides a broad, high-level discussion of the financing decisions that companies must make to achieve success. With a focus on classic capital raising, the text covers the debt vs. equity decision, as well as the options available to smaller businesses. It also describes the factors that lead to rapid growth, including venture capital, IPOs, angels, incubators, and much more. Combining solid theory with practitioner's experience and insights, this book should increase student understanding of how to raise entrepreneurial capital. It explains how your company should position itself to attract private equity investment, and what steps you can take to improve your company's marketability. It includes several chapters on worldwide regional variations on forms and availability of pre-seed capital, incubators, and the business plans they create, with case-studies from Europe, Latin America, and the Pacific Rim. It also effectively differentiates between venture capital and entrepreneurial capital. This book will appeal to entrepreneurs and to students in Entrepreneurship programs, particularly entrepreneurial finance courses. * Combines solid theory with practitioner's experience and insights * Case studies illustrate theory throughout the book * Describes worldwide and regional variations in capital raising strategies",

Indeed, some of the methods used today in salmonid rearing are nearly identical to those employed one hundred years ago. Areas of salmonid research today include nutrition, smolt and stress physiology, genetics and biotechnology. The purpose of this book is to provide a useful synthesis of the biology and culture of salmonid fishes. The important practices in salmonid culture as well as the theory behind them is described. This volume will be of interest to students, researchers, fisheries biologists and managers as well as practising aquaculturists.",

The \"Smart Grid\" requires new technologies throughout energy generation, transmission and distribution, and even the homes and businesses being served by the grid. This also represents new information paths between these new systems and services, all of which represents risk, requiring a more thorough approach to where and how cyber security controls are implemented. This insight provides a detailed architecture of the entire Smart Grid, with recommended cyber security measures for everything from the supply chain to the consumer. Discover the potential of the Smart Grid Learn in depth about its systems See its vulnerabilities and how best to protect it",

This is the hub of the strongest growth area in the world economy and while attention has focussed on job growth and industrial transformation, there has been very little attention on employment characteristics and employment conditions. In particular, the book addresses the issue of whether globalisation, taken to mean the growing international integration of economies, is a factor that leads to a convergence of employment conditions, and more importantly, an improvement in employment conditions. The book brings together contributions on many Asian economies where these core questions are considered at both the macro level and for specified industries.

    "description": "The great strides made over the past decade in the complexity and network functionality of embedded systems have significantly enhanced their attractiveness for use in critical applications such as medical devices and military communications. However, this expansion into critical areas has presented embedded engineers with a serious new problem: their designs are now being targeted by the same malicious attackers whose predations have plagued traditional systems for years. Rising concerns about data security in embedded devices are leading engineers to pay more attention to security assurance in their designs than ever before. This is particularly challenging due to embedded devices’ inherent resource constraints such as limited power and memory. Therefore, traditional security solutions must be customized to fit their profile, and entirely new security concepts must be explored. However, there are few resources available to help engineers understand how to implement security measures within the unique embedded context. This new book from embedded security expert Timothy Stapko is the first to provide engineers with a comprehensive guide to this pivotal topic. From a brief review of basic security concepts, through clear explanations of complex issues such as choosing the best cryptographic algorithms for embedded utilization, the reader is provided with all the information needed to successfully produce safe, secure embedded devices. The ONLY book dedicated to a comprehensive coverage of embedded security! Covers both hardware- and software-based embedded security solutions for preventing and dealing with attacks Application case studies support practical explanations of all key topics, including network protocols, wireless and cellular communications, languages (Java and C/++), compilers, web-based interfaces, cryptography, and an entire section on SSL",

    "description": "The International Security Programs Benchmark Report presents and analyzes the findings of a broad survey conducted by the Security Executive Council of corporate international security programs. The report identifies the types of international security baseline programs in place for a range of company sizes, and describes the organizational perception of security’s role and capability. The data suggest that international security programs are greatly affected by the company size and the location of the security department within the organization, whether as part of the executive, legal, or human resources function. Security leaders can gain valuable insights from this report regarding the scope of international security programs at key corporations with contextualized comparison points for evaluating their own programs. The International Security Programs Benchmark Report is a part of Elsevier’s Security Executive Council Risk Management Portfolio, a collection of real world solutions and \"how-to\" guidelines that equip executives, practitioners, and educators with proven information for successful security and risk management programs. Summarizes the key points of a broad survey on international security programs conducted by the Security Executive Council Breaks down survey responses by company size and functional location of security within the organization Provides insight into other organizations’ existing international security programs and services",

    "description": "Building upon his earlier book that detailed agile data warehousing programming techniques for the Scrum master, Ralph's latest work illustrates the agile interpretations of the remaining software engineering disciplines: Requirements management benefits from streamlined templates that not only define projects quickly, but ensure nothing essential is overlooked. Data engineering receives two new \"hyper modeling\" techniques, yielding data warehouses that can be easily adapted when requirements change without having to invest in ruinously expensive data-conversion programs. Quality assurance advances with not only a stereoscopic top-down and bottom-up planning method, but also the incorporation of the latest in automated test engines. Use this step-by-step guide to deepen your own application development skills through self-study, show your teammates the world's fastest and most reliable techniques for creating business intelligence systems, or ensure that the IT department working for you is building your next decision support system the right way. Learn how to quickly define scope and architecture before programming starts Includes techniques of process and data engineering that enable iterative and incremental delivery Demonstrates how to plan and execute quality assurance plans and includes a guide to continuous integration and automated regression testing Presents program management strategies for coordinating multiple agile data mart projects so that over time an enterprise data warehouse emerges Use the provided 120-day road map to establish a robust, agile data warehousing program",

It considers the core investigative and analysis concepts that are critical to the work of professionals within the digital forensic analysis community, as well as the need for immediate response once an incident has been identified. Organized into eight chapters, the book discusses Volume Shadow Copies (VSCs) in the context of digital forensics and explains how analysts can access the wealth of information available in VSCs without interacting with the live system or purchasing expensive solutions. It also describes files and data structures that are new to Windows 7 (or Vista), Windows Registry Forensics, how the presence of malware within an image acquired from a Windows system can be detected, the idea of timeline analysis as applied to digital forensic analysis, and concepts and techniques that are often associated with dynamic malware analysis. Also included are several tools written in the Perl scripting language, accompanied by Windows executables. This book will prove useful to digital forensic analysts, incident responders, law enforcement officers, students, researchers, system administrators, hobbyists, or anyone with an interest in digital forensic analysis of Windows 7 systems. Timely 3e of a Syngress digital forensic bestseller Updated to cover Windows 7 systems, the newest Windows version New online companion website houses checklists, cheat sheets, free tools, and demos",

    "description": "Fashion and beauty have helped shape history and today more than ever, we find ourselves under increasing pressure to think about what we wear, what we look good in and how best to enhance our body shape and size. Behind this seemingly superficial industry, however, lies a technical thinking firmly grounded in science and technology. In one fully comprehensive book, Clothing appearance and fit: Science and technology provides a critical appreciation of the technological developments and scientific understanding of the appearance and fit of clothing. The authors bridge the science of beauty and fashion design with garment evaluation technology, garment drape and human anthropometrics and sizing. The ten chapters of the book provide a detailed coverage of clothing appearance and fit. Chapter 1 considers body attractiveness and how it relates to clothing material and design parameters and discusses classical and contemporary theories of beauty. Chapters 2 and 3 present the industry’s techniques, methods and standards for assessing clothing appearance and fit and Chapters 4 and 5 review the research and development of objective measurement technologies for evaluating clothing appearance and fit. Fabric objective measurement, fabric properties and garment drape are covered in Chapters 6 and 7 and the R & D of body measurement, anthropometrics and sizing systems are detailed in Chapters 8 and 9. The final chapter reviews published work on garment design and pattern alteration for achieving good clothing appearance and fit. This book is an essential reference for researchers, academics, professionals and students in clothing and textile academia and industry. It includes many industrial standards, techniques and practices. Offers a critical appreciation of technological developments Incorporates user-friendly illustrations and photographs Valuable reference for students, researchers and professionals in the clothing and textile industries",

    "description": "Ever-changing business needs have prompted large companies to rethink their enterprise IT. Today, businesses must allow interaction with their customers, partners, and employees at more touch points and at a depth never thought previously. At the same time, rapid advances in information technologies, like business digitization, cloud computing, and Web 2.0, demand fundamental changes in the enterprises’ management practices. These changes have a drastic effect not only on IT and business, but also on policies, processes, and people. Many companies therefore embark on enterprise-wide transformation initiatives. The role of Enterprise Architecture (EA) is to architect and supervise this transformational journey. Unfortunately, today’s EA is often a ponderous and detached exercise, with most of the EA initiatives failing to create visible impact. The enterprises need an EA that is agile and responsive to business dynamics. Collaborative Enterprise Architecture provides the innovative solutions today’s enterprises require, informed by real-world experiences and experts’ insights. This book, in its first part, provides a systematic compendium of the current best practices in EA, analyzes current ways of doing EA, and identifies its constraints and shortcomings. In the second part, it leaves the beaten tracks of EA by introducing Lean, Agile, and Enterprise 2.0 concepts to the traditional EA methods. This blended approach to EA focuses on practical aspects, with recommendations derived from real-world experiences. A truly thought provoking and pragmatic guide to manage EA, Collaborative Enterprise Architecture effectively merges the long-term oriented top-down approach with pragmatic bottom-up thinking, and that way offers real solutions to businesses undergoing enterprise-wide change. Covers the latest emerging technologies affecting business practice, including digitization, cloud computing, agile software development, and Web 2.0 Focuses on the practical implementation of EAM rather than theory, with recommendations based on real-world case studies Addresses changing business demands and practices, including Enterprise 2.0, open source, global sourcing, and more Takes an innovative approach to EAM, merging standard top-down and pragmatic, bottom-up strategies, offering real solutions to businesses undergoing enterprise-wide changes",

    "description": "Civic entrepreneurship lies at the heart of the Arab Spring. From the iconic image of an occupied Tahrir Square to scenes of dancing protesters in Syria and politically conscious hip hop in Tunisia, people across the Middle East and North Africa continue to collaborate and experiment their way out of years of dictatorship and political stagnation. The Future of the Arab Spring examines the spirit of civic entrepreneurship that brought once untouchable dictators to their knees and continues to shape the region's political, artistic, and technology sectors. Through interviews with some of the region's leading civic entrepreneurs, including political activists, artists, and technologists, Maryam Jamshidi broadens popular understandings of recent events in this misunderstood region of the world. Features first-hand interviews with some of the most important political, cultural, and economic players on the ground in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, and other Arab Spring countries Offers a window into a region often misunderstood in the United States Illuminates the potential for positive, grassroots change in the social, political, and economic systems of Arab countries",

    "description": "Developing a Comprehensive Security Program answers the question common among security managers, \"What is a model security program, and how does our program compare to it?\" In this seven-minute Proven Practices presentation, narrator Elizabeth Lancaster outlines the baseline elements of a security program, which have been defined by experienced Security Executive Council members and research. This presentation is not sector-specific--meaning it's applicable for all organizations and industries. In addition to the baseline security program elements, Lancaster also discusses business-aligned program elements, program characteristics, a program maturity model, and the skills and knowledge the security department needs to possess. Developing a Comprehensive Security Program may be used as a benchmark for existing programs and to educate senior management. It also provides a general understanding of the security function as it currently exists. Developing a Comprehensive Security Program is a part of Elsevier's Security Executive Council Risk Management Portfolio, a collection of real world solutions and \"how-to\" guidelines that equip executives, practitioners, and educators with proven information for successful security and risk management programs. The seven-minute, visual PowerPoint presentation with audio narration format is excellent for group learning Information is drawn from the many years of collective knowledge and experience of the Security Executive Council community Identifies program characteristics and the knowledge areas and skills security leaders should possess",

    "description": "In 2010, India celebrated its 60th anniversary as an independent sovereign republic. India is the fourth largest economy by gross domestic product. Economically, it is building itself as a formidable force and global influence. At the same time India has fundamental challenges: its inequities are visible; its young population tread a thin line between opportunity and pitfall; its infrastructure has gaping holes; and it’s a slow chaotic democracy. This book establishes that in spite of these challenges, a new India is emerging out of the old, colliding more often than collaborating with the old India. Much of the new India is built on the economic momentum established 20 years ago and built by private entrepreneurs. The new economic climate, together with talent and entrepreneurship, is also making India a net supplier of innovation. Going by current trends, India will become an innovation super power by 2035. This book will establish that India is not just leveraging innovation for global competitiveness alone, but is also leveraging innovation as the specific instrument for inclusive growth. This book identifies gaps in the current innovation ecosystem and recommends a portfolio approach and calls for a National Innovation System (NIS) as a blueprint to fix the gaps. It suggests that for India to succeed in identifying, funding and sustaining a balanced innovation portfolio, India will also have to succeed in eliminating poverty, increase its rural GDP manifold, and provide employment, education and health for all its citizens. Click Here to view the official page for this title on Facebook. Establishes and analyses the trends that support India’s global emergence as an Innovation Superpower Identifies three critical levels of innovation namely grassroots innovation, national innovation and innovation for global competitiveness Recommends a portfolio approach as a blueprint for the creation of a National Innovation System",

    "description": "This book is about women directors in China and India. The aim of the book is to understand more clearly where women are present on corporate boards, and the reasons for their continued absence from most listed company boards. The Glass Ceiling in Chinese and Indian Boardrooms is written at a time of increasing awareness, particularly in Europe, of the benefits of gender equity at the boardroom table, and of the costs of women’s continued exclusion from corporate decision-making. Norway’s gender equity legislation has now been instrumental in ensuring that women occupy over 40% of all company board seats in that country. France, Italy and Spain are amongst those countries now following the same path towards equity. But Asia in general, and the world’s two largest nations in particular, still lag well behind. In China while women enjoy greater social and economic equality than many of their sisters in other parts of Asia, the male-dominated nature of the Party-state apparatus makes it unlikely that legislative change will be achieved any time soon. In India, while the country’s 2013 Corporations Law now requires all major listed firms to have at least one woman director, the real challenges for women are social and economic, where much work remains to be done. Based on detailed surveys of 1,000 key listed firms in India and China Provides results from empirical questionnaire surveys of key firms Analyses the importance of board diversity in a rapidly changing world, and its significance for economic and environmental stability",

    "description": "Most introductory texts provide a technology-based survey of methods and techniques that leaves the reader without a clear understanding of the interrelationships between methods and techniques. By providing a strategy-based introduction, the reader is given a clear understanding of how to provide overlapping defenses for critical information. This understanding provides a basis for engineering and risk-management decisions in the defense of information. Information security is a rapidly growing field, with a projected need for thousands of professionals within the next decade in the government sector alone. It is also a field that has changed in the last decade from a largely theory-based discipline to an experience-based discipline. This shift in the field has left several of the classic texts with a strongly dated feel. Provides a broad introduction to the methods and techniques in the field of information security Offers a strategy-based view of these tools and techniques, facilitating selection of overlapping methods for in-depth defense of information Provides very current view of the emerging standards of practice in information security",

With particular focus on the role of institutional factors such as labour unions or workers’ associations, case studies are presented on labour-management relations at the workplace that have evolved to cope with globalization. The cases describe labour institutions in the society as a social force that acts as a catalyst for societal democracy and for industrial democracy at the workplace. These cases provide descriptions of the changes in the management’s stance and approaches towards labour unions in the selected countries as well as at the organizational level over the last three decades when much of the industrialization process has occurred in Asia. A case study approach which enhances analytical and problem-solving skills of students A focus on the impact of globalization process in the East and Southeast Asia which is becoming more significant in the new economy Prepared by local Asian research scholars",

ColdFusion is a Web application development tool that allows programmers to quickly build robust applications using server-side markup language. It is incredibly popular and has both an established user base and a quickly growing number of new adoptions. It has become the development environment of choice for e-commerce sites and content sites where databases and transactions are the most vulnerable and where security is of the utmost importance. Several security concerns exist for ColdFusion due to its unique approach of designing pages using dynamic-page templates rather than static HTML documents. Because ColdFusion does not require that developers have expertise in Visual Basic, Java and C++; Web applications created using ColdFusion Markup language are vulnerable to a variety of security breaches. Hack Proofing ColdFusion 5.0 is the seventh edition in the popular Hack Proofing series and provides developers with step-by-step instructions for developing secure web applications. Teaches strategy and techniques: Using forensics-based analysis this book gives the reader insight to the mind of a hacker Interest in topic continues to grow: Network architects, engineers and administrators are scrambling for security books to help them protect their new networks and applications powered by ColdFusion Unrivalled Web-based support: Up-to-the minute links, white papers and analysis for two years at solutions@syngress.com",

C# for Java Programmers will prepare readers for the .NET framework by building on what they already know about object-oriented languages and give them the means to maintain their flexibility and effectiveness in an un-certain marketplace. This book will compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of both Java and C# to allow programmers to make their own decisions regarding what each language is best used for. Whatever your feelings are about Microsoft and its .NET initiative, there can be no denying that C# is here to stay. The C# language, a close cousin to Java, is a new object-oriented programming language (OOPL) designed to work within the .NET framework. It improves upon many of the vague or ill-defined areas of C++ that frequently lead programmers into trouble. C# is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language designed to give the optimum blend of simplicity, expressiveness, and performance. Written specifically for Java programmers. C# for Java Programmers is not an introductory guide to C#, but builds on what Java programmers already know about object-oriented languages to give them an efficient means for making in-roads to the .NET framework. Compare and Contrast. This book will compare and contrast many of the advantages and drawbacks of Java and C# to allow programmers to make informed, intelligent decisions based on the unique uses of each language.",

    "description": "Linux servers now account for 33% of all networks servers running worldwide (Source: IDC). The top 3 market share holders in the network server space (IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell) all use Linux as their standard operating system. This book teaches Linux system administrators how to protect their servers from malicious threats. As with any technologies, increased usage results in increased attention from malicious hackers. For years a myth existed that Windows was inherently less secure than Linux, because there were significantly more attacks against Windows machines than Linux. This was a fallacy. There were more attacks against Windows machines because there were simply so many more Windows machines to attack. Now, the numbers tell the exact opposite story. Linux servers account for 1/3 of all servers worldwide, but in 2005 there were 3 times as many high-severity security vulnerabilities discovered on Linux servers (Source: IDC). This book covers Open Source security, implementing an intrusion detection system, unearthing Rootkits, defending against malware, creating Virtual Private Networks, and much more. The Perfect Reference for the Multitasked SysAdmin * Discover Why \"Measure Twice, Cut Once\" Applies to Securing Linux * Complete Coverage of Hardening the Operating System, Implementing an Intrusion Detection System, and Defending Databases * Short on Theory, History, and Technical Data that Is Not Helpful in Performing Your Job",

The presentation of these 20 projects on DVD media provides users with benefits and options not available on the printed page. All images are hi-res color that can be enlarged or printed, the text is easily searched, and the user can copy the contents to their hard disk and add comments directly into the PDF files. The DVD media also lends itself well to group projects (it includes a 10 user license). The 160-page book includes chapters on hacking tools and electrical engineering basics, along with chapters on the background, design and functionality of each hardware device. * Packed full of high resolution colour images that reveal the smallest details of each step in a hack * Includes in depth coverage of the tools of the hacking trade and the basics of electrical engineering * DVD includes a \"Using the Tools\" video starring Joe \"kingpin\" Grand",

    "description": "This all new book covering the brand new Snort version 2.6 from members of the Snort developers team. This fully integrated book and Web toolkit covers everything from packet inspection to optimizing Snort for speed to using the most advanced features of Snort to defend even the largest and most congested enterprise networks. Leading Snort experts Brian Caswell, Andrew Baker, and Jay Beale analyze traffic from real attacks to demonstrate the best practices for implementing the most powerful Snort features. The book will begin with a discussion of packet inspection and the progression from intrusion detection to intrusion prevention. The authors provide examples of packet inspection methods including: protocol standards compliance, protocol anomaly detection, application control, and signature matching. In addition, application-level vulnerabilities including Binary Code in HTTP headers, HTTP/HTTPS Tunneling, URL Directory Traversal, Cross-Site Scripting, and SQL Injection will also be analyzed. Next, a brief chapter on installing and configuring Snort will highlight various methods for fine tuning your installation to optimize Snort performance including hardware/OS selection, finding and eliminating bottlenecks, and benchmarking and testing your deployment. A special chapter also details how to use Barnyard to improve the overall performance of Snort. Next, best practices will be presented allowing readers to enhance the performance of Snort for even the largest and most complex networks. The next chapter reveals the inner workings of Snort by analyzing the source code. The next several chapters will detail how to write, modify, and fine-tune basic to advanced rules and pre-processors. Detailed analysis of real packet captures will be provided both in the book and the companion material. Several examples for optimizing output plugins will then be discussed including a comparison of MySQL and PostrgreSQL. Best practices for monitoring Snort sensors and analyzing intrusion data follow with examples of real world attacks using: ACID, BASE, SGUIL, SnortSnarf, Snort_stat.pl, Swatch, and more. The last part of the book contains several chapters on active response, intrusion prevention, and using Snort’s most advanced capabilities for everything from forensics and incident handling to building and analyzing honey pots. This fully integrated book and Web toolkit covers everything all in one convenient package It is authored by members of the Snort team and it is packed full of their experience and expertise Includes full coverage of the brand new Snort version 2.6, packed full of all the latest information",

    "description": "RFID is a method of remotely storing and receiving data using devices called RFID tags. RFID tags can be small adhesive stickers containing antennas that receive and respond to transmissions from RFID transmitters. RFID tags are used to identify and track everything from food, dogs, beer kegs to library books. RFID tags use a standard that has already been hacked by several researchers. RFID Security discusses the motives for someone wanting to hack an RFID system and shows how to protect systems. Coverage includes: security breaches for monetary gain (hacking a shops RFID system would allow a hacker to lower the pricing on any product products). How to protect the supply chain (malicous/mischievous hackers can delete/alter/modify all identifying information for an entire shipment of products). How to protect personal privacy (privacy advocates fear that RFID tags embedded in products, which continue to transmit information after leaving a store, will be used to track consumer habits). The purpose of an RFID system is to enable data to be transmitted by a portable device, called a tag, which is read by an RFID reader and processed according to the needs of a particular application. The data transmitted by the tag may provide identification or location information, or specifics about the product tagged, such as price, colour, date of purchase, etc. . * Deloitte & Touche expects over 10 billion RFID tags to be in circulation by the end of 2005 * Parties debating the security issue of RFID need information on the pros and cons of the technology and this is that information * Little competition in a market desperate for information",

This includes investment bankers, commercial banks, accountancy firms, property firms, public sector including local government and healthcare, PFI/PPP enterprises, financial managers and financially literate general managers. Junior/middle management, where the focus would be on cash flow forecasting and budgeting tasks, will also find this book of value. For the vast majority of people involved in this subject, financial modelling is an activity, a task requiring skills. Once people have the ability to structure the model, they have a better starting point from which to address the financial problems. This new book proposal intends to offer that starting point. Theory is limited to the absolute essentials that aid understanding; thus the focus with this new book is very practical - this is \"how-to-do-it\", showing best practice, and is illustrated with many practical worked examples. * Practical financial modelling- all the essentials in one book * How-to approach, with numerous worked examples * Explains the techniques and functions of Excel most use in financial modelling and budgeting",

    "description": "The Basics of Web Hacking introduces you to a tool-driven process to identify the most widespread vulnerabilities in Web applications. No prior experience is needed. Web apps are a \"path of least resistance\" that can be exploited to cause the most damage to a system, with the lowest hurdles to overcome. This is a perfect storm for beginning hackers. The process set forth in this book introduces not only the theory and practical information related to these vulnerabilities, but also the detailed configuration and usage of widely available tools necessary to exploit these vulnerabilities. The Basics of Web Hacking provides a simple and clean explanation of how to utilize tools such as Burp Suite, sqlmap, and Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), as well as basic network scanning tools such as nmap, Nikto, Nessus, Metasploit, John the Ripper, web shells, netcat, and more. Dr. Josh Pauli teaches software security at Dakota State University and has presented on this topic to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the NSA, BlackHat Briefings, and Defcon. He will lead you through a focused, three-part approach to Web security, including hacking the server, hacking the Web app, and hacking the Web user. With Dr. Pauli’s approach, you will fully understand the what/where/why/how of the most widespread Web vulnerabilities and how easily they can be exploited with the correct tools. You will learn how to set up a safe environment to conduct these attacks, including an attacker Virtual Machine (VM) with all necessary tools and several known-vulnerable Web application VMs that are widely available and maintained for this very purpose. Once you complete the entire process, not only will you be prepared to test for the most damaging Web exploits, you will also be prepared to conduct more advanced Web hacks that mandate a strong base of knowledge. Provides a simple and clean approach to Web hacking, including hands-on examples and exercises that are designed to teach you how to hack the server, hack the Web app, and hack the Web user Covers the most significant new tools such as nmap, Nikto, Nessus, Metasploit, John the Ripper, web shells, netcat, and more! Written by an author who works in the field as a penetration tester and who teaches Web security classes at Dakota State University",

It has been created for corporate professionals who are often the first to be contacted during a suspected employee-related claim, and who may not have investigative training. Sections of this playbook address the decision whether to investigate, the naming of investigators, investigation planning, interview techniques and issues, the importance of taking notes and written statements, investigations in union settings, and much more. Also included are a series of checklists and templates to aid the investigative team before, during, and after an investigation. This playbook is an excellent risk management resource for audit professionals, human resources managers, site or facility managers, small business owners, or anyone who may be the first to receive reports of wrongdoing, regulatory violations, or prohibited workforce behavior. The Compliance Response to Misconduct Allegations is a part of Elsevier’s Security Executive Council Risk Management Portfolio, a collection of real world solutions and \"how-to\" guidelines that equip executives, practitioners, and educators with proven information for successful security and risk management programs.

    "description": "The Basics of Cyber Safety: Computer and Mobile Device Safety Made Easy presents modern tactics on how to secure computer and mobile devices, including what behaviors are safe while surfing, searching, and interacting with others in the virtual world. The book's author, Professor John Sammons, who teaches information security at Marshall University, introduces readers to the basic concepts of protecting their computer, mobile devices, and data during a time that is described as the most connected in history. This timely resource provides useful information for readers who know very little about the basic principles of keeping the devices they are connected to—or themselves—secure while online. In addition, the text discusses, in a non-technical way, the cost of connectedness to your privacy, and what you can do to it, including how to avoid all kinds of viruses, malware, cybercrime, and identity theft. Final sections provide the latest information on safe computing in the workplace and at school, and give parents steps they can take to keep young kids and teens safe online. Provides the most straightforward and up-to-date guide to cyber safety for anyone who ventures online for work, school, or personal use Includes real world examples that demonstrate how cyber criminals commit their crimes, and what users can do to keep their data safe",

    "description": "In Bringing a Corporate Security Culture to Life, presenter Peter Cheviot, former vice president of corporate security for BAX Global Inc., discusses how to build and maintain a corporate security culture that encourages company employees to take ownership of security and facilitates communication. In this 18-minute video presentation of narrated slides, the concept of \"security culture\" is defined, and Cheviot explains how it can improve the effectiveness of security and risk management programs. Security culture refers to the idea that the security manager must encourage shared ownership of and accountability for the organization’s security program among all employees. In this presentation, the ways to achieve a good security culture are outlined. They include impressing the return on investment (ROI) of security services, designating security ambassadors for various functional areas of the business, providing training, connecting with senior management, and sharing security program performance results. When employees and other business stakeholders feel that they have ownership over security policies, the results are higher compliance, return on investment, and net gains through continuous improvements. The tools and recommendations found in Bringing a Corporate Security Culture to Life will help security managers and their teams achieve these results. Bringing a Corporate Security Culture to Life is a part of Elsevier’s Security Executive Council Risk Management Portfolio, a collection of real world solutions and \"how-to\" guidelines that equip executives, practitioners, and educators with proven information for successful security and risk management programs. The 18-minute, visual PowerPoint presentation with audio narration format is excellent for group learning Introduces the concept of workplace security culture and explains how it can help further the objectives of the security program Encourages a top-down approach: When top management is invested in the security culture, the rest of the organization will naturally follow their lead",

The researchers' objective was to benchmark the state of the security industry in terms of organizational structure, budget, staff resources, board-level risk concerns, program drivers, and services provided. The level of responsibility each respondent reported for a list of 30 security programs or services is also compared across several organizational categories. This report can be used by security professionals for introspective analysis of the security team within their organizations, external review of the ways in which other organizations approach risk management, internal justification of security budgets and initiatives, and for performance metrics. Corporate Security Organizational Structure, Cost of Services and Staffing Benchmark is a part of Elsevier’s Security Executive Council Risk Management Portfolio, a collection of real world solutions and \"how-to\" guidelines that equip executives, practitioners, and educators with proven information for successful security and risk management programs. Summarizes the key findings of a large survey on security programs conducted by the Security Executive Council’s Security Leadership Research Institute (SLRI) Breaks down survey responses by organization size, scope of responsibility, industry, and more in easy-to-read charts and tables Provides invaluable insight into other organizations’ existing security programs and services",

    "description": "The primary goal of the Information Protection Playbook is to serve as a comprehensive resource for information protection (IP) professionals who must provide adequate information security at a reasonable cost. It emphasizes a holistic view of IP: one that protects the applications, systems, and networks that deliver business information from failures of confidentiality, integrity, availability, trust and accountability, and privacy. Using the guidelines provided in the Information Protection Playbook, security and information technology (IT) managers will learn how to implement the five functions of an IP framework: governance, program planning, risk management, incident response management, and program administration. These functions are based on a model promoted by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and validated by thousands of Certified Information Security Managers. The five functions are further broken down into a series of objectives or milestones to be achieved in order to implement an IP framework. The extensive appendices included at the end of the book make for an excellent resource for the security or IT manager building an IP program from the ground up. They include, for example, a board of directors presentation complete with sample slides; an IP policy document checklist; a risk prioritization procedure matrix, which illustrates how to classify a threat based on a scale of high, medium, and low; a facility management self-assessment questionnaire; and a list of representative job descriptions for roles in IP. The Information Protection Playbook is a part of Elsevier’s Security Executive Council Risk Management Portfolio, a collection of real world solutions and \"how-to\" guidelines that equip executives, practitioners, and educators with proven information for successful security and risk management programs. Emphasizes information protection guidelines that are driven by business objectives, laws, regulations, and industry standards Draws from successful practices in global organizations, benchmarking, advice from a variety of subject-matter experts, and feedback from the organizations involved with the Security Executive Council Includes 11 appendices full of the sample checklists, matrices, and forms that are discussed in the book",

    "description": "Fisheries are in a state of crisis throughout the world. While there has been some success, truly effective fisheries management seems beyond our grasp. The knowledge needed for proper management contains a broad array of facts and connections from statistical stock assessments, to the information that allows government agencies to track compliance with rules and beyond. This book describes the state-of-the-art knowledge about fishery systems. Seldom seen in a scientific publication regarding fisheries science, this book presents a multidisciplinary perspective of fisheries management. Leading fisheries scholars with backgrounds in biology, ecology, economics and sociology ask how management institutions can learn and put their lessons to use. The Knowledge Base for Fisheries Management offers a unique overview of the world of fisheries management and provides the background to draw conclusions of what is needed to improve management. Covering a wide range of regimes, case studies and professional perspectives, this publication will be an obliged reference to anyone involved on fisheries management, assessment, policy making or fisheries development all over the world. * The only book on the market that analyzes fisheries in a biological, sociological and economic way * Fills a gap, focusing not only on the production of knowledge for fisheries management but also on how it is used in all steps of the management system and the decision making processes * Focuses on the hot topic: scientific knowledge and society-science based policies * Documents disseminated research from many different management systems, both European and world wide",

In this unique and engaging book covering the brand new OS X 10.4 Tiger, the world’s foremost “true hackers unleash the power of OS X for everything form cutting edge research and development to just plain old fun. OS X 10.4 Tiger is a major upgrade for Mac OS X for running Apple’s Macintosh computers and laptops. This book is not a reference to every feature and menu item for OS X. Rather, it teaches hackers of all types from software developers to security professionals to hobbyists, how to use the most powerful (and often obscure) features of OS X for wireless networking, WarDriving, software development, penetration testing, scripting administrative tasks, and much more. * Analyst reports indicate that OS X sales will double in 2005. OS X Tiger is currently the #1 selling software product on Amazon and the 12-inch PowerBook is the #1 selling laptop * Only book on the market directly appealing to groundswell of hackers migrating to OS X * Each chapter written by hacker most commonly associated with that topic, such as Chris Hurley (Roamer) organizer of the World Wide War Drive",

These headlines not only have caught the attention of people around the world, they have had a significant effect on IT professionals as well. As technology continues to become more integral to corporate operations at every level of the organization, the job of IT has expanded to become almost all-encompassing. These days, it’s difficult to find corners of a company that technology does not touch. As a result, the need to plan for potential disruptions to technology services has increased exponentially. That is what Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is: a methodology used to create a plan for how an organization will recover after a disaster of various types. It takes into account both security and corporate risk management tatics. There is a lot of movement around this initiative in the industry: the British Standards Institute is releasing a new standard for BCP this year. Trade shows are popping up covering the topic. * Complete coverage of the 3 categories of disaster: natural hazards, human-caused hazards, and accidental and technical hazards. * Only published source of information on the new BCI standards and government requirements. * Up dated information on recovery from cyber attacks, rioting, protests, product tampering, bombs, explosions, and terrorism.",

Has the time arrived to educate emergency managers in college classrooms rather than in twenty years of tactical operations experience? Over one hundred forty-three (143) institutions of higher education are now offering certificate or degree programs in emergency management with no tactical operations experience required for admission. Resistance by veteran law enforcement officers and fire fighters may have to be overcome if we are to prepare emergency managers with required skill sets. Dr. Tom Phelan explores the skills being taught to emergency management students and addresses the concerns of experienced first responders in accepting their leadership. *Discusses the value of emergency management education in the post-9/11 world *Makes clear the need for educating emergency managers to prepare them for emergency manager leadership *Helps bridge the gap between emergency management and first responders *Should be required reading in every college emergency management curriculum *The book is clear, concise, and an \"easy read\"",

    "description": "It is now seen as essential that all businesses assess their exposure to business risk especially in relation to value creation. This book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact it has on the value of your business. It offers vital, accessible and timely tools to assist you in making an immediate difference to the core value of your business and thereby satisfy the demands of an ever increasing range of stakeholders. This book will help you: • Discover how risk exposure can have a financial impact on your business • Make your business become more sustainable financially, socially and environmentally • Learn how to apply knowledge fast with this practical guide to risk management issues The sustainable approach covered by this book spans business survival to more recent issues, such as the use of energy and natural resources. It highlights the value of a more enlightened approach throughout an organization. In doing so the book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact on value using the Sustainable and Economic Risk Management (SERM) methodology which considers: • inherent risk • management of risk • residual risk exposure. By exploring the various frameworks that organizations operate in today – whether compulsory, compliance driven, voluntary or motivated by best practice – the book offers a practical tool through the SERM model which is at the heart of the book’s approach to risk management. This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * Explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organization. * Examples of how risks are quantified and explanations of how risk exposure can have a real ‘material’ financial impact on an organization * Provides best practice examples along with case studies that demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organizations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally",

    "description": "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds.",

    "description": "In reaction to the continually changing business climate companies develop many business strategies to increase their competitiveness and improve profitability. Companies regularly reshape themselves continually exploring new markets and developing new products. When they can't expand into new markets or develop new products on their own, they seek alternatives. These alternatives include merging with or acquiring other companies to create a single more capable company. Companies acquire other companies for a wide variety of reasons. In some cases company survival may actually be the reason. What does this condition mean to the security professional? In the course of mergers and acquisitions, security plays a vital role in helping to make the endeavor successful. There are numerous titles on the business aspects of M&A such as the ones listed below. However, this unique book focuses on the role security plays in helping to make a merger, acquisition or divestiture successful. It addresses the fundamental security elements that are required to support the effort. In addition, it provides an integrated \"how to\" approach to implementing M&A security complete with methods and processes that have been quickly and cost-effectively implemented. - First book available that focuses on the role of the Security Manager in M&A - Case studies that highlight the role of the security manager; cases include both best practices as well as illustrations of nightmare examples of what NOT to do - Lead author is an expert that has participated in/managed security for more than 20 high-profile and large-scale acquisitions - Model processes, procedures, checklists, charts and sample forms all serve to ease immediate analysis and implementation in a merger or acquisition",

Case studies are an effective method of learning the methods and processes that were both successful and unsuccessful in real cases. Using a variety of case types, including civil and criminal cases, with different cybercrimes, a broad base of knowledge can be gained by comparing the cases against each other. The primary goal of reviewing successful cases involving suspects using technology to facilitate crimes is to be able to find and use the same methods in future cases. This \"first look\" teaches you how to place the suspect behind the keyboard using case studies.",

Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment.",

    "description": "Now in its 20th edition, \"Advances in Accounting\" continues to provide an important forum for discourse among and between academic and practicing accountants on issues of significance to the future of the discipline. Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits).

    "description": "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job! You have made a complex subject highly accessible. It is very readable for anyone engaged in business whether in a small firm or a major corporation. - Peter Hutton, Managing Director of Brand Energy Research and formerly Group Development Director for MORI “Great concept: nicely executed and well written.

    "description": "Virgin Lands: Two Years in Kazakhstan, 1954-5 focuses on the life, career, and experiences of L. I. Brezhnev when he stayed in Kazakhstan to push for the improvement of the agriculture sector of the country. The book first offers information on the experiences of L. I. Brezhnev as a farmer, land-use surveyor, metallurgist, factory worker, and politician. Brezhnev underscores how he pushed for the organization of collective farms. The text also highlights the poor state of agriculture in the country, including the farming methodologies that Brezhnev and his countrymen have adopted to overcome the extreme conditions of farming lands. The manuscript details the improvement of state farms, particularly noting the increase in harvest and the number of farms to be set up. Brezhnev narrates how the state farms are affected by drought and extreme weather conditions, and how they have doubled the crop areas through the use of farm implements. The book also underscores the role of farm machineries in the increase of production of grain, meat, and vegetables. The text is a dependable source of data for readers interested in the life and career of L. I. Brezhnev, particularly his dedication to develop agriculture in Kazakhstan.",

    "description": "Motor Disturbances II contains a selection of papers presented at the 2nd Congress of the International Medical Society of Motor Disturbances held in Rome, Italy, on June 2-4, 1988. Contributors focus on topics related to motor disturbances ranging from bradykinesia and akinesia to cranial movement disorders, weakness and the involvement of upper motor neurons in motor disturbances, and techniques such as neuroimaging and cortical stimulation. Organized into six sections comprised of 37 chapters, this compilation begins with an overview of the physiological aspects of electrical and magnetic stimulation of the human brain. It then discusses the PET scanning in Parkinson's disease (PD), levodopa and lisuride intravenous infusions in fluctuating Parkinsonian patients, and temporal discrimination and bradykinesia in PD patients. It explains the pathophysiological aspects of cranial movement disorders, the pathophysiology of weakness and the upper motoneuron syndrome, body sway in patients with hemiparesis, and spinal reflexes and central programming in spastic paresis during stance and gait. The book concludes with an analysis of motor disturbances in musicians. This book will appeal to neurologists, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, medical practitioners, clinical researchers, and anyone interested in motor disturbances.",

India is using an intelligent economic process for its renewal and growth, however, in a recent study by Nomura, 2016, The Japanese Financial Services firm, it is reported that there is downside risk to India’s baseline forecast of 7.8 per cent GDP growth in 2016. Although the report suggests that there was a mid-cycle consolidation in mid-2014, the recovery seems to be losing momentum. This book offers a novel, but inclusive outlook to the entire post-Modi economic overhaul. Offers a comprehensive narrative of the current economic scene in India Explores how the measures for reform are intelligent, while also considering their weaknesses Shows how India has a strong potential to grow amidst diversity of economic reforms and changing governance Includes a compilation of insightful articles on Indian economic reform and future prospects",

    "description": "Insecure transportation systems are costing our worldwide mobility-based economy as much as 6% of GDP annually. The effectiveness of security measures vary widely. In the United States, depending on the mode of transportation, it ranges from “medium effectiveness for airports to “low effectiveness for maritime, rail, transit, and intermodal activities. Situational awareness and interoperability are lacking as we try to deal with both natural and man-made disasters. Regardless of the transport mode, improvements are essential if governments and corporations are to address security planning, response, and national preparedness. Transportation Security examines this problem in a comprehensive manner and addresses security-based technologies and solutions to minimize risk. * Covers air, sea, roadway, rail and public transport modes * Offers technological solutions for mobility based problems in planning, logistics and policy to improve security, combat terrorism and ensure national preparedness * Includes work of international experts & global examples related to transportation security",

It has been created for corporate professionals who are often the first to be contacted during a suspected employee-related claim, and who may not have investigative training. This revised edition has been expanded to include background information for audit, facilities and building management, human resources, IT security, and other non-security business functions. Sections of this book address the decision whether to investigate, the naming of investigators, investigation planning, interview techniques and issues, the importance of taking notes and written statements, investigations in union settings, and much more. Also included are a series of checklists and templates to aid the investigative team before, during, and after an investigation. This playbook is an excellent risk management resource for audit professionals, human resources managers, site or facility managers, small business owners, or anyone who may be the first to receive reports of wrongdoing, regulatory violations, or prohibited workforce behavior. The Business Response to Misconduct Allegations is a part of Elsevier’s Security Executive Council Risk Management Portfolio, a collection of real world solutions and \"how-to\" guidelines that equip executives, practitioners, and educators with proven information for successful security and risk management programs. Newly added material includes information for audit, facilities and building management, human resources, IT security, and non-security personnel Describes the ethical and legal reasons for a company to follow up on and take every employee complaint seriously Provides a framework of best practices the investigative team can use to prepare for and conduct workplace investigations Includes a series of checklists and templates to aid the investigative team before, during, and after the investigation",

    "description": "There is considerably more skill in the IT and security communities than is reflected in the jobs people are able to attain. Most people's limiting factor in their ability to get better jobs is not technical skills or even the soft skills necessary to do well in a new job. It is that getting a job is a completely different skill set and one that most people only practice every few years. Job Reconnaissance: Using Hacking Skills to Win the Job Hunt Game explains the job hunting process, why the most commonly followed models fail and how to better approach the search. It covers the entire job hunt process from when to decide to leave your current job, research new possible job opportunities, targeting your new boss, controlling the job interview process and negotiating your new compensation and the departure from your current job. This is not a complete all-in-one job-hunting book. This book assumes that the reader is reasonably competent and has already heard most of the \"standard\" advice, but is having difficulty putting the advice into practice. The goal is to fill in the gaps of the other books and to help the readers use their technical skills to their advantage in a different context. The emphasis in Job Reconnaissance is for infosec and IT job seekers to leverage the same skills they use in penetration testing and recon toward job-hunting success. These skills include targeting, reconnaissance and profiling combined with a technical look at skills other career search books commonly miss. Covers the entire job hunt process from when to decide to leave your current job to the departure of your current job Suggests how to research new possible job opportunities Shows how to target your new boss, controlling the job interview process and negotiating your new compensation",

This purpose of this handbook is to introduce the theoretical foundations and practical solution techniques for securing critical cyber and physical infrastructures as well as their underlying computing and communication architectures and systems. Examples of such infrastructures include utility networks (e.g., electrical power grids), ground transportation systems (automotives, roads, bridges and tunnels), airports and air traffic control systems, wired and wireless communication and sensor networks, systems for storing and distributing water and food supplies, medical and healthcare delivery systems, as well as financial, banking and commercial transaction assets. The handbook focus mostly on the scientific foundations and engineering techniques – while also addressing the proper integration of policies and access control mechanisms, for example, how human-developed policies can be properly enforced by an automated system. Addresses the technical challenges facing design of secure infrastructures by providing examples of problems and solutions from a wide variety of internal and external attack scenarios Includes contributions from leading researchers and practitioners in relevant application areas such as smart power grid, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare industry and so on Loaded with examples of real world problems and pathways to solutions utilizing specific tools and techniques described in detail throughout",

Now, Social Engineering Penetration Testing gives you the practical methodology and everything you need to plan and execute a social engineering penetration test and assessment. You will gain fascinating insights into how social engineering techniques including email phishing, telephone pretexting, and physical vectors can be used to elicit information or manipulate individuals into performing actions that may aid in an attack. Using the book's easy-to-understand models and examples, you will have a much better understanding of how best to defend against these attacks. The authors of Social Engineering Penetration Testing show you hands-on techniques they have used at RandomStorm to provide clients with valuable results that make a real difference to the security of their businesses. You will learn about the differences between social engineering pen tests lasting anywhere from a few days to several months. The book shows you how to use widely available open-source tools to conduct your pen tests, then walks you through the practical steps to improve defense measures in response to test results. Understand how to plan and execute an effective social engineering assessment Learn how to configure and use the open-source tools available for the social engineer Identify parts of an assessment that will most benefit time-critical engagements Learn how to design target scenarios, create plausible attack situations, and support various attack vectors with technology Create an assessment report, then improve defense measures in response to test results",

    "description": "A Guide to Kernel Exploitation: Attacking the Core discusses the theoretical techniques and approaches needed to develop reliable and effective kernel-level exploits, and applies them to different operating systems, namely, UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, and Windows. Concepts and tactics are presented categorically so that even when a specifically detailed vulnerability has been patched, the foundational information provided will help hackers in writing a newer, better attack; or help pen testers, auditors, and the like develop a more concrete design and defensive structure. The book is organized into four parts. Part I introduces the kernel and sets out the theoretical basis on which to build the rest of the book. Part II focuses on different operating systems and describes exploits for them that target various bug classes. Part III on remote kernel exploitation analyzes the effects of the remote scenario and presents new techniques to target remote issues. It includes a step-by-step analysis of the development of a reliable, one-shot, remote exploit for a real vulnerabilitya bug affecting the SCTP subsystem found in the Linux kernel. Finally, Part IV wraps up the analysis on kernel exploitation and looks at what the future may hold. Covers a range of operating system families — UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, Windows Details common scenarios such as generic memory corruption (stack overflow, heap overflow, etc.) issues, logical bugs and race conditions Delivers the reader from user-land exploitation to the world of kernel-land (OS) exploits/attacks, with a particular focus on the steps that lead to the creation of successful techniques, in order to give to the reader something more than just a set of tricks",

    "description": "Seven Deadliest Network Attacks identifies seven classes of network attacks and discusses how the attack works, including tools to accomplish the attack, the risks of the attack, and how to defend against the attack. This book pinpoints the most dangerous hacks and exploits specific to networks, laying out the anatomy of these attacks including how to make your system more secure. You will discover the best ways to defend against these vicious hacks with step-by-step instruction and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable. The book consists of seven chapters that deal with the following attacks: denial of service; war dialing; penetration testing; protocol tunneling; spanning tree attacks; man-in-the-middle; and password replay. These attacks are not mutually exclusive and were chosen because they help illustrate different aspects of network security. The principles on which they rely are unlikely to vanish any time soon, and they allow for the possibility of gaining something of interest to the attacker, from money to high-value data. This book is intended to provide practical, usable information. However, the world of network security is evolving very rapidly, and the attack that works today may (hopefully) not work tomorrow. It is more important, then, to understand the principles on which the attacks and exploits are based in order to properly plan either a network attack or a network defense. Seven Deadliest Network Attacks will appeal to information security professionals of all levels, network admins, and recreational hackers. Knowledge is power, find out about the most dominant attacks currently waging war on computers and networks globally Discover the best ways to defend against these vicious attacks; step-by-step instruction shows you how Institute countermeasures, don’t be caught defenseless again, and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable",

But few marketing investments are evaluated from this perspective. Increasingly, boards of directors and city analysts the world over are dissatisfied with this lack of accountability. Cranfield School of Management has been addressing this problem by working with a range of blue-chip companies. They have created a new framework which shows how marketing systematically contributes to shareholder value based on three key questions- • Does the promised market exist? • Will the strategy deliver the market share promised? • Will the market share create shareholder value? This groundbreaking new book explains the principles and practice behind rigorous due diligence in marketing for Marketing and Finance Directors, CEOs, Strategists and MBA students wanting to understand the key drivers of modern business Surely, the time has come for marketing directors to take their rightful place in the boardroom by proving that what they are doing creates shareholder value added? * Connects marketing plans and investment to the valuation of the firm and how it can contribute to increasing shareholder value * Systematic and practical approach useful for both practitioners and students * New paperback edition",

    "description": "Is emergency management education undoing an age-old tradition in the American Fire Service? Has the time arrived to educate emergency managers in college classrooms rather than in twenty years of tactical operations experience? Over one hundred forty-three (143) institutions of higher education are now offering certificate or degree programs in emergency management with no tactical operations experience required for admission. Resistance by veteran law enforcement officers and fire fighters may have to be overcome if we are to prepare emergency managers with required skill sets. Dr. Tom Phelan explores the skills being taught to emergency management students and addresses the concerns of experienced first responders in accepting their leadership. *Discusses the value of emergency management education in the post-9/11 world *Makes clear the need for educating emergency managers to prepare them for emergency manager leadership *Helps bridge the gap between emergency management and first responders *Should be required reading in every college emergency management curriculum *The book is clear, concise, and an \"easy read\"",

    "description": "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds.",

But few marketing investments are evaluated from this perspective. Increasingly, boards of directors and city analysts the world over are dissatisfied with this lack of accountability. Cranfield School of Management has been addressing this problem by working with a range of blue-chip companies. They have created a new framework which shows how marketing systematically contributes to shareholder value based on three key questions- • Does the promised market exist? • Will the strategy deliver the market share promised? • Will the market share create shareholder value? This groundbreaking new book explains the principles and practice behind rigorous due diligence in marketing for Marketing and Finance Directors, CEOs, Strategists and MBA students wanting to understand the key drivers of modern business Surely, the time has come for marketing directors to take their rightful place in the boardroom by proving that what they are doing creates shareholder value added? * Connects marketing plans and investment to the valuation of the firm and how it can contribute to increasing shareholder value * Systematic and practical approach useful for both practitioners and students * New paperback edition",

Has the time arrived to educate emergency managers in college classrooms rather than in twenty years of tactical operations experience? Over one hundred forty-three (143) institutions of higher education are now offering certificate or degree programs in emergency management with no tactical operations experience required for admission. Resistance by veteran law enforcement officers and fire fighters may have to be overcome if we are to prepare emergency managers with required skill sets. Dr. Tom Phelan explores the skills being taught to emergency management students and addresses the concerns of experienced first responders in accepting their leadership. *Discusses the value of emergency management education in the post-9/11 world *Makes clear the need for educating emergency managers to prepare them for emergency manager leadership *Helps bridge the gap between emergency management and first responders *Should be required reading in every college emergency management curriculum *The book is clear, concise, and an \"easy read\"",

While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds.",

    "description": "In reaction to the continually changing business climate companies develop many business strategies to increase their competitiveness and improve profitability. Companies regularly reshape themselves continually exploring new markets and developing new products. When they can't expand into new markets or develop new products on their own, they seek alternatives. These alternatives include merging with or acquiring other companies to create a single more capable company. Companies acquire other companies for a wide variety of reasons. In some cases company survival may actually be the reason. What does this condition mean to the security professional? In the course of mergers and acquisitions, security plays a vital role in helping to make the endeavor successful. There are numerous titles on the business aspects of M&A such as the ones listed below. However, this unique book focuses on the role security plays in helping to make a merger, acquisition or divestiture successful. It addresses the fundamental security elements that are required to support the effort. In addition, it provides an integrated \"how to\" approach to implementing M&A security complete with methods and processes that have been quickly and cost-effectively implemented. - First book available that focuses on the role of the Security Manager in M&A - Case studies that highlight the role of the security manager; cases include both best practices as well as illustrations of nightmare examples of what NOT to do - Lead author is an expert that has participated in/managed security for more than 20 high-profile and large-scale acquisitions - Model processes, procedures, checklists, charts and sample forms all serve to ease immediate analysis and implementation in a merger or acquisition",

    "description": "Now in its 20th edition, \"Advances in Accounting\" continues to provide an important forum for discourse among and between academic and practicing accountants on issues of significance to the future of the discipline. Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment.",

Case studies are an effective method of learning the methods and processes that were both successful and unsuccessful in real cases. Using a variety of case types, including civil and criminal cases, with different cybercrimes, a broad base of knowledge can be gained by comparing the cases against each other. The primary goal of reviewing successful cases involving suspects using technology to facilitate crimes is to be able to find and use the same methods in future cases. This \"first look\" teaches you how to place the suspect behind the keyboard using case studies.",

But few marketing investments are evaluated from this perspective. Increasingly, boards of directors and city analysts the world over are dissatisfied with this lack of accountability. Cranfield School of Management has been addressing this problem by working with a range of blue-chip companies. They have created a new framework which shows how marketing systematically contributes to shareholder value based on three key questions- • Does the promised market exist? • Will the strategy deliver the market share promised? • Will the market share create shareholder value? This groundbreaking new book explains the principles and practice behind rigorous due diligence in marketing for Marketing and Finance Directors, CEOs, Strategists and MBA students wanting to understand the key drivers of modern business Surely, the time has come for marketing directors to take their rightful place in the boardroom by proving that what they are doing creates shareholder value added? * Connects marketing plans and investment to the valuation of the firm and how it can contribute to increasing shareholder value * Systematic and practical approach useful for both practitioners and students * New paperback edition",

Over one hundred forty-three (143) institutions of higher education are now offering certificate or degree programs in emergency management with no tactical operations experience required for admission. Resistance by veteran law enforcement officers and fire fighters may have to be overcome if we are to prepare emergency managers with required skill sets. Dr. Tom Phelan explores the skills being taught to emergency management students and addresses the concerns of experienced first responders in accepting their leadership. *Discusses the value of emergency management education in the post-9/11 world *Makes clear the need for educating emergency managers to prepare them for emergency manager leadership *Helps bridge the gap between emergency management and first responders *Should be required reading in every college emergency management curriculum *The book is clear, concise, and an \"easy read\"",

    "description": "It is now seen as essential that all businesses assess their exposure to business risk especially in relation to value creation. This book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact it has on the value of your business. It offers vital, accessible and timely tools to assist you in making an immediate difference to the core value of your business and thereby satisfy the demands of an ever increasing range of stakeholders. This book will help you: • Discover how risk exposure can have a financial impact on your business • Make your business become more sustainable financially, socially and environmentally • Learn how to apply knowledge fast with this practical guide to risk management issues The sustainable approach covered by this book spans business survival to more recent issues, such as the use of energy and natural resources. It highlights the value of a more enlightened approach throughout an organization. In doing so the book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact on value using the Sustainable and Economic Risk Management (SERM) methodology which considers: • inherent risk • management of risk • residual risk exposure. By exploring the various frameworks that organizations operate in today – whether compulsory, compliance driven, voluntary or motivated by best practice – the book offers a practical tool through the SERM model which is at the heart of the book’s approach to risk management. This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * Explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organization. * Examples of how risks are quantified and explanations of how risk exposure can have a real ‘material’ financial impact on an organization * Provides best practice examples along with case studies that demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organizations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally",

    "description": "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds.",

    "description": "In reaction to the continually changing business climate companies develop many business strategies to increase their competitiveness and improve profitability. Companies regularly reshape themselves continually exploring new markets and developing new products. When they can't expand into new markets or develop new products on their own, they seek alternatives. These alternatives include merging with or acquiring other companies to create a single more capable company. Companies acquire other companies for a wide variety of reasons. In some cases company survival may actually be the reason. What does this condition mean to the security professional? In the course of mergers and acquisitions, security plays a vital role in helping to make the endeavor successful. There are numerous titles on the business aspects of M&A such as the ones listed below. However, this unique book focuses on the role security plays in helping to make a merger, acquisition or divestiture successful. It addresses the fundamental security elements that are required to support the effort. In addition, it provides an integrated \"how to\" approach to implementing M&A security complete with methods and processes that have been quickly and cost-effectively implemented. - First book available that focuses on the role of the Security Manager in M&A - Case studies that highlight the role of the security manager; cases include both best practices as well as illustrations of nightmare examples of what NOT to do - Lead author is an expert that has participated in/managed security for more than 20 high-profile and large-scale acquisitions - Model processes, procedures, checklists, charts and sample forms all serve to ease immediate analysis and implementation in a merger or acquisition",

Case studies are an effective method of learning the methods and processes that were both successful and unsuccessful in real cases. Using a variety of case types, including civil and criminal cases, with different cybercrimes, a broad base of knowledge can be gained by comparing the cases against each other. The primary goal of reviewing successful cases involving suspects using technology to facilitate crimes is to be able to find and use the same methods in future cases. This \"first look\" teaches you how to place the suspect behind the keyboard using case studies.",

Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment.",

    "description": "Now in its 20th edition, \"Advances in Accounting\" continues to provide an important forum for discourse among and between academic and practicing accountants on issues of significance to the future of the discipline. Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment.",

    "description": "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job! You have made a complex subject highly accessible. It is very readable for anyone engaged in business whether in a small firm or a major corporation. - Peter Hutton, Managing Director of Brand Energy Research and formerly Group Development Director for MORI “Great concept: nicely executed and well written. Financial Ratios has a logical structure and flows well – I really enjoyed reading it and couldn’t put it down! - Dr David Hillson FRSA FAPM FIRM FCMI, Director of Risk Doctor and Partners. * Financial ratios can add value to any business - understand how * Do you your customers need to understand what the finance department is telling them and what they should do about it? * Understand the strengths and shortcomings of financial ratios which will help you grow and manage your business * Accompanying CD enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises",

But few marketing investments are evaluated from this perspective. Increasingly, boards of directors and city analysts the world over are dissatisfied with this lack of accountability. Cranfield School of Management has been addressing this problem by working with a range of blue-chip companies. They have created a new framework which shows how marketing systematically contributes to shareholder value based on three key questions- • Does the promised market exist? • Will the strategy deliver the market share promised? • Will the market share create shareholder value? This groundbreaking new book explains the principles and practice behind rigorous due diligence in marketing for Marketing and Finance Directors, CEOs, Strategists and MBA students wanting to understand the key drivers of modern business Surely, the time has come for marketing directors to take their rightful place in the boardroom by proving that what they are doing creates shareholder value added? * Connects marketing plans and investment to the valuation of the firm and how it can contribute to increasing shareholder value * Systematic and practical approach useful for both practitioners and students * New paperback edition",

Has the time arrived to educate emergency managers in college classrooms rather than in twenty years of tactical operations experience? Over one hundred forty-three (143) institutions of higher education are now offering certificate or degree programs in emergency management with no tactical operations experience required for admission. Resistance by veteran law enforcement officers and fire fighters may have to be overcome if we are to prepare emergency managers with required skill sets. Dr. Tom Phelan explores the skills being taught to emergency management students and addresses the concerns of experienced first responders in accepting their leadership. *Discusses the value of emergency management education in the post-9/11 world *Makes clear the need for educating emergency managers to prepare them for emergency manager leadership *Helps bridge the gap between emergency management and first responders *Should be required reading in every college emergency management curriculum *The book is clear, concise, and an \"easy read\"",

    "description": "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds.",

As you read the book, you will notice that the authors took the approach of identifying some of the risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and then discussing the countermeasures to address them. Some of the topics and thoughts discussed here are as new as tomorrow’s headlines, whereas others have been around for decades without being properly addressed. I hope you enjoy this book as much as we have enjoyed working with the various authors and friends during its development. —Donald Withers, CEO and Cofounder of TheTrainingCo. • Jack Wiles, on Social Engineering offers up a potpourri of tips, tricks, vulnerabilities, and lessons learned from 30-plus years of experience in the worlds of both physical and technical security. • Russ Rogers on the Basics of Penetration Testing illustrates the standard methodology for penetration testing: information gathering, network enumeration, vulnerability identification, vulnerability exploitation, privilege escalation, expansion of reach, future access, and information compromise. • Johnny Long on No Tech Hacking shows how to hack without touching a computer using tailgating, lock bumping, shoulder surfing, and dumpster diving. • Phil Drake on Personal, Workforce, and Family Preparedness covers the basics of creating a plan for you and your family, identifying and obtaining the supplies you will need in an emergency. • Kevin O’Shea on Seizure of Digital Information discusses collecting hardware and information from the scene. • Amber Schroader on Cell Phone Forensics writes on new methods and guidelines for digital forensics. • Dennis O’Brien on RFID: An Introduction, Security Issues, and Concerns discusses how this well-intended technology has been eroded and used for fringe implementations. • Ron Green on Open Source Intelligence details how a good Open Source Intelligence program can help you create leverage in negotiations, enable smart decisions regarding the selection of goods and services, and help avoid pitfalls and hazards. • Raymond Blackwood on Wireless Awareness: Increasing the Sophistication of Wireless Users maintains it is the technologist’s responsibility to educate, communicate, and support users despite their lack of interest in understanding how it works. • Greg Kipper on What is Steganography? provides a solid understanding of the basics of steganography, what it can and can’t do, and arms you with the information you need to set your career path. • Eric Cole on Insider Threat discusses why the insider threat is worse than the external threat and the effects of insider threats on a company.

    "description": "A cross site scripting attack is a very specific type of attack on a web application. It is used by hackers to mimic real sites and fool people into providing personal data. XSS Attacks starts by defining the terms and laying out the ground work. It assumes that the reader is familiar with basic web programming (HTML) and JavaScript. First it discusses the concepts, methodology, and technology that makes XSS a valid concern. It then moves into the various types of XSS attacks, how they are implemented, used, and abused. After XSS is thoroughly explored, the next part provides examples of XSS malware and demonstrates real cases where XSS is a dangerous risk that exposes internet users to remote access, sensitive data theft, and monetary losses. Finally, the book closes by examining the ways developers can avoid XSS vulnerabilities in their web applications, and how users can avoid becoming a victim. The audience is web developers, security practitioners, and managers. XSS Vulnerabilities exist in 8 out of 10 Web sites The authors of this book are the undisputed industry leading authorities Contains independent, bleeding edge research, code listings and exploits that can not be found anywhere else",

    "description": "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job! You have made a complex subject highly accessible. It is very readable for anyone engaged in business whether in a small firm or a major corporation. - Peter Hutton, Managing Director of Brand Energy Research and formerly Group Development Director for MORI “Great concept: nicely executed and well written. Financial Ratios has a logical structure and flows well – I really enjoyed reading it and couldn’t put it down! - Dr David Hillson FRSA FAPM FIRM FCMI, Director of Risk Doctor and Partners. * Financial ratios can add value to any business - understand how * Do you your customers need to understand what the finance department is telling them and what they should do about it? * Understand the strengths and shortcomings of financial ratios which will help you grow and manage your business * Accompanying CD enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises",

These entities and self-regulatory organizations such as U.S. State Societies of CPAs and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and equivalent and emerging national bodies that exist in most developed and developing countries, are among the emerging entities which attempt to coordinate the activities of professional accountants among sovereign nations.

But few marketing investments are evaluated from this perspective. Increasingly, boards of directors and city analysts the world over are dissatisfied with this lack of accountability. Cranfield School of Management has been addressing this problem by working with a range of blue-chip companies. They have created a new framework which shows how marketing systematically contributes to shareholder value based on three key questions- • Does the promised market exist? • Will the strategy deliver the market share promised? • Will the market share create shareholder value? This groundbreaking new book explains the principles and practice behind rigorous due diligence in marketing for Marketing and Finance Directors, CEOs, Strategists and MBA students wanting to understand the key drivers of modern business Surely, the time has come for marketing directors to take their rightful place in the boardroom by proving that what they are doing creates shareholder value added? * Connects marketing plans and investment to the valuation of the firm and how it can contribute to increasing shareholder value * Systematic and practical approach useful for both practitioners and students * New paperback edition",

Has the time arrived to educate emergency managers in college classrooms rather than in twenty years of tactical operations experience? Over one hundred forty-three (143) institutions of higher education are now offering certificate or degree programs in emergency management with no tactical operations experience required for admission. Resistance by veteran law enforcement officers and fire fighters may have to be overcome if we are to prepare emergency managers with required skill sets. Dr. Tom Phelan explores the skills being taught to emergency management students and addresses the concerns of experienced first responders in accepting their leadership. *Discusses the value of emergency management education in the post-9/11 world *Makes clear the need for educating emergency managers to prepare them for emergency manager leadership *Helps bridge the gap between emergency management and first responders *Should be required reading in every college emergency management curriculum *The book is clear, concise, and an \"easy read\"",

    "description": "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds.",

    "description": "In reaction to the continually changing business climate companies develop many business strategies to increase their competitiveness and improve profitability. Companies regularly reshape themselves continually exploring new markets and developing new products. When they can't expand into new markets or develop new products on their own, they seek alternatives. These alternatives include merging with or acquiring other companies to create a single more capable company. Companies acquire other companies for a wide variety of reasons. In some cases company survival may actually be the reason. What does this condition mean to the security professional? In the course of mergers and acquisitions, security plays a vital role in helping to make the endeavor successful. There are numerous titles on the business aspects of M&A such as the ones listed below. However, this unique book focuses on the role security plays in helping to make a merger, acquisition or divestiture successful. It addresses the fundamental security elements that are required to support the effort. In addition, it provides an integrated \"how to\" approach to implementing M&A security complete with methods and processes that have been quickly and cost-effectively implemented. - First book available that focuses on the role of the Security Manager in M&A - Case studies that highlight the role of the security manager; cases include both best practices as well as illustrations of nightmare examples of what NOT to do - Lead author is an expert that has participated in/managed security for more than 20 high-profile and large-scale acquisitions - Model processes, procedures, checklists, charts and sample forms all serve to ease immediate analysis and implementation in a merger or acquisition",

    "description": "Now in its 20th edition, \"Advances in Accounting\" continues to provide an important forum for discourse among and between academic and practicing accountants on issues of significance to the future of the discipline. Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment.",

Case studies are an effective method of learning the methods and processes that were both successful and unsuccessful in real cases. Using a variety of case types, including civil and criminal cases, with different cybercrimes, a broad base of knowledge can be gained by comparing the cases against each other. The primary goal of reviewing successful cases involving suspects using technology to facilitate crimes is to be able to find and use the same methods in future cases. This \"first look\" teaches you how to place the suspect behind the keyboard using case studies.",

Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment.",

This book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact it has on the value of your business. It offers vital, accessible and timely tools to assist you in making an immediate difference to the core value of your business and thereby satisfy the demands of an ever increasing range of stakeholders. This book will help you: • Discover how risk exposure can have a financial impact on your business • Make your business become more sustainable financially, socially and environmentally • Learn how to apply knowledge fast with this practical guide to risk management issues The sustainable approach covered by this book spans business survival to more recent issues, such as the use of energy and natural resources. It highlights the value of a more enlightened approach throughout an organization. In doing so the book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact on value using the Sustainable and Economic Risk Management (SERM) methodology which considers: • inherent risk • management of risk • residual risk exposure. By exploring the various frameworks that organizations operate in today – whether compulsory, compliance driven, voluntary or motivated by best practice – the book offers a practical tool through the SERM model which is at the heart of the book’s approach to risk management. This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * Explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organization. * Examples of how risks are quantified and explanations of how risk exposure can have a real ‘material’ financial impact on an organization * Provides best practice examples along with case studies that demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organizations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally",

    "description": "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job! You have made a complex subject highly accessible. It is very readable for anyone engaged in business whether in a small firm or a major corporation. - Peter Hutton, Managing Director of Brand Energy Research and formerly Group Development Director for MORI “Great concept: nicely executed and well written. Financial Ratios has a logical structure and flows well – I really enjoyed reading it and couldn’t put it down! - Dr David Hillson FRSA FAPM FIRM FCMI, Director of Risk Doctor and Partners. * Financial ratios can add value to any business - understand how * Do you your customers need to understand what the finance department is telling them and what they should do about it? * Understand the strengths and shortcomings of financial ratios which will help you grow and manage your business * Accompanying CD enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises",

In the United States, depending on the mode of transportation, it ranges from “medium effectiveness for airports to “low effectiveness for maritime, rail, transit, and intermodal activities. Situational awareness and interoperability are lacking as we try to deal with both natural and man-made disasters. Regardless of the transport mode, improvements are essential if governments and corporations are to address security planning, response, and national preparedness.

    "description": "Virgin Lands: Two Years in Kazakhstan, 1954-5 focuses on the life, career, and experiences of L. I. Brezhnev when he stayed in Kazakhstan to push for the improvement of the agriculture sector of the country. The book first offers information on the experiences of L. I. Brezhnev as a farmer, land-use surveyor, metallurgist, factory worker, and politician. Brezhnev underscores how he pushed for the organization of collective farms. The text also highlights the poor state of agriculture in the country, including the farming methodologies that Brezhnev and his countrymen have adopted to overcome the extreme conditions of farming lands. The manuscript details the improvement of state farms, particularly noting the increase in harvest and the number of farms to be set up. Brezhnev narrates how the state farms are affected by drought and extreme weather conditions, and how they have doubled the crop areas through the use of farm implements. The book also underscores the role of farm machineries in the increase of production of grain, meat, and vegetables. The text is a dependable source of data for readers interested in the life and career of L. I. Brezhnev, particularly his dedication to develop agriculture in Kazakhstan.",

    "description": "Motor Disturbances II contains a selection of papers presented at the 2nd Congress of the International Medical Society of Motor Disturbances held in Rome, Italy, on June 2-4, 1988. Contributors focus on topics related to motor disturbances ranging from bradykinesia and akinesia to cranial movement disorders, weakness and the involvement of upper motor neurons in motor disturbances, and techniques such as neuroimaging and cortical stimulation. Organized into six sections comprised of 37 chapters, this compilation begins with an overview of the physiological aspects of electrical and magnetic stimulation of the human brain. It then discusses the PET scanning in Parkinson's disease (PD), levodopa and lisuride intravenous infusions in fluctuating Parkinsonian patients, and temporal discrimination and bradykinesia in PD patients. It explains the pathophysiological aspects of cranial movement disorders, the pathophysiology of weakness and the upper motoneuron syndrome, body sway in patients with hemiparesis, and spinal reflexes and central programming in spastic paresis during stance and gait. The book concludes with an analysis of motor disturbances in musicians. This book will appeal to neurologists, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, medical practitioners, clinical researchers, and anyone interested in motor disturbances.",

It is the first of an annual book mini-series surveying issues in this critical and rapidly changing area. These changes affect the health, safety, and well-being of literally billions of consumers, their governments, and the corporations involved in the prodigious task of not only creating novel, effective and safe products, but also complying with regulations, that vary from country to country. This book begins with a discussion of the risks assessment of cosmetic products. This is followed by separate chapters on the regulatory system in some of the major export markets of Canada and Australasia; the evolution and purpose of the EU's REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization of Chemicals); the issue of cosmetic toxicity; and regulatory requirements and warnings for cosmetic products. Subsequent chapters cover the challenges of global chemical compliance; the development of nanotechnology-based products and their potential impact on human health and the environment; and the various packaging regulations relating to colors and additives for products marketed in North America, the EU, and Asia.",

The author's approach is based on the analysis of time aggregation adjacent periods of the traffic. As traffic varies throughout the day, it is essential to consider the concrete traffic period in which the anomaly occurs. This book presents the algorithms proposed specifically for this analysis and an empirical comparative analysis of those methods and settle a new information theory based technique, named \"typical day analysis\". A new information-theory based technique for traffic anomaly detection (typical day analysis) Introductory chapters to anomaly detection methods including control charts, tests of goodness-of-fit Mutual Information Contains comparative analysis of traffic anomaly detection methods",

    "description": "A cross site scripting attack is a very specific type of attack on a web application. It is used by hackers to mimic real sites and fool people into providing personal data. XSS Attacks starts by defining the terms and laying out the ground work. It assumes that the reader is familiar with basic web programming (HTML) and JavaScript. First it discusses the concepts, methodology, and technology that makes XSS a valid concern. It then moves into the various types of XSS attacks, how they are implemented, used, and abused. After XSS is thoroughly explored, the next part provides examples of XSS malware and demonstrates real cases where XSS is a dangerous risk that exposes internet users to remote access, sensitive data theft, and monetary losses. Finally, the book closes by examining the ways developers can avoid XSS vulnerabilities in their web applications, and how users can avoid becoming a victim. The audience is web developers, security practitioners, and managers. XSS Vulnerabilities exist in 8 out of 10 Web sites The authors of this book are the undisputed industry leading authorities Contains independent, bleeding edge research, code listings and exploits that can not be found anywhere else",

    "description": "This book is the definitive guide on the OSSEC Host-based Intrusion Detection system and frankly, to really use OSSEC you are going to need a definitive guide. Documentation has been available since the start of the OSSEC project but, due to time constraints, no formal book has been created to outline the various features and functions of the OSSEC product. This has left very important and powerful features of the product undocumented...until now! The book you are holding will show you how to install and configure OSSEC on the operating system of your choice and provide detailed examples to help prevent and mitigate attacks on your systems. -- Stephen Northcutt OSSEC determines if a host has been compromised in this manner by taking the equivalent of a picture of the host machine in its original, unaltered state. This \"picture\" captures the most relevant information about that machine's configuration. OSSEC saves this \"picture\" and then constantly compares it to the current state of that machine to identify anything that may have changed from the original configuration. Now, many of these changes are necessary, harmless, and authorized, such as a system administrator installing a new software upgrade, patch, or application. But, then there are the not-so-harmless changes, like the installation of a rootkit, trojan horse, or virus. Differentiating between the harmless and the not-so-harmless changes determines whether the system administrator or security professional is managing a secure, efficient network or a compromised network which might be funneling credit card numbers out to phishing gangs or storing massive amounts of pornography creating significant liability for that organization. Separating the wheat from the chaff is by no means an easy task. Hence the need for this book. The book is co-authored by Daniel Cid, who is the founder and lead developer of the freely available OSSEC host-based IDS. As such, readers can be certain they are reading the most accurate, timely, and insightful information on OSSEC. * Nominee for Best Book Bejtlich read in 2008! * http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/best-book-bejtlich-read-in-2008.html • Get Started with OSSEC Get an overview of the features of OSSEC including commonly used terminology, pre-install preparation, and deployment considerations. • Follow Steb-by-Step Installation Instructions Walk through the installation process for the \"local , “agent , and \"server\" install types on some of the most popular operating systems available. • Master Configuration Learn the basic configuration options for your install type and learn how to monitor log files, receive remote messages, configure email notification, and configure alert levels. • Work With Rules Extract key information from logs using decoders and how you can leverage rules to alert you of strange occurrences on your network. • Understand System Integrity Check and Rootkit Detection Monitor binary executable files, system configuration files, and the Microsoft Windows registry. • Configure Active Response Configure the active response actions you want and bind the actions to specific rules and sequence of events. • Use the OSSEC Web User Interface Install, configure, and use the community-developed, open source web interface available for OSSEC. • Play in the OSSEC VMware Environment Sandbox • Dig Deep into Data Log Mining Take the “high art of log analysis to the next level by breaking the dependence on the lists of strings or patterns to look for in the logs.",

    "description": "A Guide to Kernel Exploitation: Attacking the Core discusses the theoretical techniques and approaches needed to develop reliable and effective kernel-level exploits, and applies them to different operating systems, namely, UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, and Windows. Concepts and tactics are presented categorically so that even when a specifically detailed vulnerability has been patched, the foundational information provided will help hackers in writing a newer, better attack; or help pen testers, auditors, and the like develop a more concrete design and defensive structure. The book is organized into four parts. Part I introduces the kernel and sets out the theoretical basis on which to build the rest of the book. Part II focuses on different operating systems and describes exploits for them that target various bug classes. Part III on remote kernel exploitation analyzes the effects of the remote scenario and presents new techniques to target remote issues. It includes a step-by-step analysis of the development of a reliable, one-shot, remote exploit for a real vulnerabilitya bug affecting the SCTP subsystem found in the Linux kernel. Finally, Part IV wraps up the analysis on kernel exploitation and looks at what the future may hold. Covers a range of operating system families — UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, Windows Details common scenarios such as generic memory corruption (stack overflow, heap overflow, etc.) issues, logical bugs and race conditions Delivers the reader from user-land exploitation to the world of kernel-land (OS) exploits/attacks, with a particular focus on the steps that lead to the creation of successful techniques, in order to give to the reader something more than just a set of tricks",

But few marketing investments are evaluated from this perspective. Increasingly, boards of directors and city analysts the world over are dissatisfied with this lack of accountability. Cranfield School of Management has been addressing this problem by working with a range of blue-chip companies. They have created a new framework which shows how marketing systematically contributes to shareholder value based on three key questions- • Does the promised market exist? • Will the strategy deliver the market share promised? • Will the market share create shareholder value? This groundbreaking new book explains the principles and practice behind rigorous due diligence in marketing for Marketing and Finance Directors, CEOs, Strategists and MBA students wanting to understand the key drivers of modern business Surely, the time has come for marketing directors to take their rightful place in the boardroom by proving that what they are doing creates shareholder value added? * Connects marketing plans and investment to the valuation of the firm and how it can contribute to increasing shareholder value * Systematic and practical approach useful for both practitioners and students * New paperback edition",

Has the time arrived to educate emergency managers in college classrooms rather than in twenty years of tactical operations experience? Over one hundred forty-three (143) institutions of higher education are now offering certificate or degree programs in emergency management with no tactical operations experience required for admission. Resistance by veteran law enforcement officers and fire fighters may have to be overcome if we are to prepare emergency managers with required skill sets. Dr. Tom Phelan explores the skills being taught to emergency management students and addresses the concerns of experienced first responders in accepting their leadership. *Discusses the value of emergency management education in the post-9/11 world *Makes clear the need for educating emergency managers to prepare them for emergency manager leadership *Helps bridge the gap between emergency management and first responders *Should be required reading in every college emergency management curriculum *The book is clear, concise, and an \"easy read\"",

It offers vital, accessible and timely tools to assist you in making an immediate difference to the core value of your business and thereby satisfy the demands of an ever increasing range of stakeholders. This book will help you: • Discover how risk exposure can have a financial impact on your business • Make your business become more sustainable financially, socially and environmentally • Learn how to apply knowledge fast with this practical guide to risk management issues The sustainable approach covered by this book spans business survival to more recent issues, such as the use of energy and natural resources. It highlights the value of a more enlightened approach throughout an organization. In doing so the book explains the practical links between risk management and the impact on value using the Sustainable and Economic Risk Management (SERM) methodology which considers: • inherent risk • management of risk • residual risk exposure. By exploring the various frameworks that organizations operate in today – whether compulsory, compliance driven, voluntary or motivated by best practice – the book offers a practical tool through the SERM model which is at the heart of the book’s approach to risk management. This model, together with its global EFR model, have established proven and practical methodologies to achieve sustainable risk management techniques that are accessible to all organizations. * Explains why risk management is a significant tool in enhancing the overall value or performance of any given organization. * Examples of how risks are quantified and explanations of how risk exposure can have a real ‘material’ financial impact on an organization * Provides best practice examples along with case studies that demonstrate how risks are dealt with by organizations that are rising to the challenge to become more sustainable, financially, socially and environmentally",

    "description": "This book contains 35 carefully selected and abridged versions of scholarly financial and managerial research articles by world-class researchers ranging across a wide spectrum of the social, political and philosophical sides of financial and managerial accounting information and practices to focus on accounting's wider role and impact on organizations and society at large. While each article was substantially culled in order to highlight its central findings and its unique approach, care was exercised to maintain the integrity of the authors' work. The result is a collection of readily accessible research including: classics and seminal articles, a selection of more contemporary articles, and recent articles that go beyond the conventional. Thus, the book pushes the boundaries beyond that of conventional accounting thought and research. This anthology will be of interest especially to graduate students since it provides a broad sampling of influential research studies presented in a highly accessible format. It should also be of vital interest to sophisticated practitioners who are concerned about the current state of the accounting world in the wake of the recent cascade of so-called \"accounting scandals\". The hope also is to help bridge the gap between the practitioners' and the scholarly researchers' Worlds.",

    "description": "In reaction to the continually changing business climate companies develop many business strategies to increase their competitiveness and improve profitability. Companies regularly reshape themselves continually exploring new markets and developing new products. When they can't expand into new markets or develop new products on their own, they seek alternatives. These alternatives include merging with or acquiring other companies to create a single more capable company. Companies acquire other companies for a wide variety of reasons. In some cases company survival may actually be the reason. What does this condition mean to the security professional? In the course of mergers and acquisitions, security plays a vital role in helping to make the endeavor successful. There are numerous titles on the business aspects of M&A such as the ones listed below. However, this unique book focuses on the role security plays in helping to make a merger, acquisition or divestiture successful. It addresses the fundamental security elements that are required to support the effort. In addition, it provides an integrated \"how to\" approach to implementing M&A security complete with methods and processes that have been quickly and cost-effectively implemented. - First book available that focuses on the role of the Security Manager in M&A - Case studies that highlight the role of the security manager; cases include both best practices as well as illustrations of nightmare examples of what NOT to do - Lead author is an expert that has participated in/managed security for more than 20 high-profile and large-scale acquisitions - Model processes, procedures, checklists, charts and sample forms all serve to ease immediate analysis and implementation in a merger or acquisition",

Case studies are an effective method of learning the methods and processes that were both successful and unsuccessful in real cases. Using a variety of case types, including civil and criminal cases, with different cybercrimes, a broad base of knowledge can be gained by comparing the cases against each other. The primary goal of reviewing successful cases involving suspects using technology to facilitate crimes is to be able to find and use the same methods in future cases. This \"first look\" teaches you how to place the suspect behind the keyboard using case studies.",

    "description": "Accounting for Improvement offers concrete and constructive demonstrations of the possibilities of designing participative forms of organization. Field experiment cases illustrate how the operational level can assume a new significance in competitiveness and strategic positioning. In this way, the relevance of the accounting function to the improvement of productivity and quality is restored. Several broadly applicable lessons can be learnt, among them: how companies can strengthen their competitive base by patient improvement; how people with operative jobs can take command of their work situation and improve it in quality as well as efficiency. New bottom-up, people-orientated, empirically-founded approaches to decentralised participative management demonstrate a place for individuals and teamwork in today's \"lost relevance\" and \"smart machine\" environment.",

    "description": "Now in its 20th edition, \"Advances in Accounting\" continues to provide an important forum for discourse among and between academic and practicing accountants on issues of significance to the future of the discipline. Emphasis continues to be placed on original commentary, critical analysis and creative research - research that promises to substantively advance our understanding of financial markets, behavioral phenomenon and regulatory policy. Technology and aggressive global competition have propelled tremendous changes over the two decades since AIA was founded. A wide array of unsolved questions continues to plague a profession under fire in the aftermath of one financial debacle after another. This volume of \"Advances in Accounting\" includes articles reflective of recent economic distress: articles on the effects of post bankruptcy financial reporting, measurement of decline in earnings persistence, re-estimations of bankruptcy prediction models, and an understanding of new assurance needs. It also looks at trends of significance to academics (trends in research and dissertations focus) and practitioners (trends in IS audits). With this 20th volume, \"Advances in Accounting\" makes a new commitment to the global arena by introduction of an International Section and a new international associate editor. As never before, the accounting profession is seeking ways to reinvent itself and recapture relevance and credibility. AIA likewise continues to champion change through this revised global editorial commitment.",

    "description": "Have you ever worried about being expected to understand what finance people are saying when they quote ‘gearing ratios’ or ‘equity yields’ at you? Whether you are in a large organization or just starting out on your own you will want to avoid missing something important and know how you can achieve the financial targets that are critical to you and your business. It is important for all those engaged in business to understand how financial ratios can be used to measure the performance of a business. This has never been more urgent and important, when corporate frauds and corporate governance are high on the public agenda. However it is also important to understand how they can be used positively to maximize value and success in a business. This book covers the full scope of business. It uses a model, the Enterprise Stewardship Model which has received international acclaim, to illustrate the power – and the limitations – of financial ratios and explore the tangible and intangible aspects of creating value in a business. It shows how ratios can be used to describe, measure, and help to maximize, value and success. And it includes worked examples to illustrate how to generate and calculate key financial ratios. The CD that is included with the book enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises. It also includes a short introductory video, a slide show and some structured questions to prompt a strategic business review using ratios. Relationships are at the heart of this book. Ratios themselves are relationships – between different sets of numbers or measurements. It is important to understand them and be able to work with them. But is also important to understand and be able to work with people in a business and this book looks at different perspectives on a business and explores how financial ratios can be interpreted differently from different standpoints. “A splendid job! You have made a complex subject highly accessible. It is very readable for anyone engaged in business whether in a small firm or a major corporation. - Peter Hutton, Managing Director of Brand Energy Research and formerly Group Development Director for MORI “Great concept: nicely executed and well written. Financial Ratios has a logical structure and flows well – I really enjoyed reading it and couldn’t put it down! - Dr David Hillson FRSA FAPM FIRM FCMI, Director of Risk Doctor and Partners. * Financial ratios can add value to any business - understand how * Do you your customers need to understand what the finance department is telling them and what they should do about it? * Understand the strengths and shortcomings of financial ratios which will help you grow and manage your business * Accompanying CD enables the reader to both understand and apply the subject for themselves through the use of interactive exercises",

    "description": "Virgin Lands: Two Years in Kazakhstan, 1954-5 focuses on the life, career, and experiences of L. I. Brezhnev when he stayed in Kazakhstan to push for the improvement of the agriculture sector of the country. The book first offers information on the experiences of L. I. Brezhnev as a farmer, land-use surveyor, metallurgist, factory worker, and politician. Brezhnev underscores how he pushed for the organization of collective farms. The text also highlights the poor state of agriculture in the country, including the farming methodologies that Brezhnev and his countrymen have adopted to overcome the extreme conditions of farming lands. The manuscript details the improvement of state farms, particularly noting the increase in harvest and the number of farms to be set up. Brezhnev narrates how the state farms are affected by drought and extreme weather conditions, and how they have doubled the crop areas through the use of farm implements. The book also underscores the role of farm machineries in the increase of production of grain, meat, and vegetables. The text is a dependable source of data for readers interested in the life and career of L. I. Brezhnev, particularly his dedication to develop agriculture in Kazakhstan.",

    "description": "Motor Disturbances II contains a selection of papers presented at the 2nd Congress of the International Medical Society of Motor Disturbances held in Rome, Italy, on June 2-4, 1988. Contributors focus on topics related to motor disturbances ranging from bradykinesia and akinesia to cranial movement disorders, weakness and the involvement of upper motor neurons in motor disturbances, and techniques such as neuroimaging and cortical stimulation. Organized into six sections comprised of 37 chapters, this compilation begins with an overview of the physiological aspects of electrical and magnetic stimulation of the human brain. It then discusses the PET scanning in Parkinson's disease (PD), levodopa and lisuride intravenous infusions in fluctuating Parkinsonian patients, and temporal discrimination and bradykinesia in PD patients. It explains the pathophysiological aspects of cranial movement disorders, the pathophysiology of weakness and the upper motoneuron syndrome, body sway in patients with hemiparesis, and spinal reflexes and central programming in spastic paresis during stance and gait. The book concludes with an analysis of motor disturbances in musicians. This book will appeal to neurologists, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, medical practitioners, clinical researchers, and anyone interested in motor disturbances.",

    "description": "Changing the Indian Economy: Renewal, Reform and Revival explores the fact that post-Modi India is witnessing unprecedented socioeconomic change, truly labeled as Modi’s Mantra and his attempts to morph the Indian economic landscape. India is using an intelligent economic process for its renewal and growth, however, in a recent study by Nomura, 2016, The Japanese Financial Services firm, it is reported that there is downside risk to India’s baseline forecast of 7.8 per cent GDP growth in 2016. Although the report suggests that there was a mid-cycle consolidation in mid-2014, the recovery seems to be losing momentum. This book offers a novel, but inclusive outlook to the entire post-Modi economic overhaul. Offers a comprehensive narrative of the current economic scene in India Explores how the measures for reform are intelligent, while also considering their weaknesses Shows how India has a strong potential to grow amidst diversity of economic reforms and changing governance Includes a compilation of insightful articles on Indian economic reform and future prospects",

In the United States, depending on the mode of transportation, it ranges from “medium effectiveness for airports to “low effectiveness for maritime, rail, transit, and intermodal activities. Situational awareness and interoperability are lacking as we try to deal with both natural and man-made disasters. Regardless of the transport mode, improvements are essential if governments and corporations are to address security planning, response, and national preparedness. Transportation Security examines this problem in a comprehensive manner and addresses security-based technologies and solutions to minimize risk. * Covers air, sea, roadway, rail and public transport modes * Offers technological solutions for mobility based problems in planning, logistics and policy to improve security, combat terrorism and ensure national preparedness * Includes work of international experts & global examples related to transportation security",

    "description": "Construction Calculations is a manual that provides end users with a comprehensive guide for many of the formulas, mathematical vectors and conversion factors that are commonly encountered during the design and construction stages of a construction project. It offers readers detailed calculations, applications and examples needed in site work, cost estimation, piping and pipefitting, and project management. The book also serves as a refresher course for some of the formulas and concepts of geometry and trigonometry. The book is divided into sections that present the common components of construction. The first section of the books starts with a refresher discussion of unit and systems measurement; its origin and evolution; the standards of length, mass and capacity; terminology and tables; and notes of metric, U.S, and British units of measurements. The following concepts are presented and discussed throughout the book: Conversion tables and formulas, including the Metric Conversion Law and conversion factors for builders and design professionals Calculations and formulas of geometry, trigonometry and physics in construction Rudiments of excavation, classification, use of material, measurement and payment Soil classification and morphology, including its physicochemical properties Formulas and calculations needed for soil tests and evaluations and for the design of retaining structures Calculations relating to concrete and masonry Calculations of the size/weight of structural steel and other metals Mechanical properties of wood and processing of wood products Calculations relating to sound and thermal transmission Interior finishes, plumbing and HVAC calculations Electrical formulas and calculations Construction managers and engineers, architects, contractors, and beginners in engineering, architecture, and construction will find this practical guide useful for managing all aspects of construction. Work in and convert between building dimensions, including metric Built-in right-angle solutions Areas, volumes, square-ups Complete stair layouts Roof, rafter and framing solutions Circle: arcs, circumference, segments",

    "description": "The third edition of The Business Response to Misconduct Allegations is a step-by-step guide for what to do—and what not to do—in performing an investigation into claims of employee policy violations. It has been created for corporate professionals who are often the first to be contacted during a suspected employee-related claim, and who may not have investigative training. This revised edition has been expanded to include background information for audit, facilities and building management, human resources, IT security, and other non-security business functions. Sections of this book address the decision whether to investigate, the naming of investigators, investigation planning, interview techniques and issues, the importance of taking notes and written statements, investigations in union settings, and much more. Also included are a series of checklists and templates to aid the investigative team before, during, and after an investigation.

    "description": "There is considerably more skill in the IT and security communities than is reflected in the jobs people are able to attain. Most people's limiting factor in their ability to get better jobs is not technical skills or even the soft skills necessary to do well in a new job. It is that getting a job is a completely different skill set and one that most people only practice every few years. Job Reconnaissance: Using Hacking Skills to Win the Job Hunt Game explains the job hunting process, why the most commonly followed models fail and how to better approach the search. It covers the entire job hunt process from when to decide to leave your current job, research new possible job opportunities, targeting your new boss, controlling the job interview process and negotiating your new compensation and the departure from your current job. This is not a complete all-in-one job-hunting book. This book assumes that the reader is reasonably competent and has already heard most of the \"standard\" advice, but is having difficulty putting the advice into practice. The goal is to fill in the gaps of the other books and to help the readers use their technical skills to their advantage in a different context. The emphasis in Job Reconnaissance is for infosec and IT job seekers to leverage the same skills they use in penetration testing and recon toward job-hunting success. These skills include targeting, reconnaissance and profiling combined with a technical look at skills other career search books commonly miss. Covers the entire job hunt process from when to decide to leave your current job to the departure of your current job Suggests how to research new possible job opportunities Shows how to target your new boss, controlling the job interview process and negotiating your new compensation",

    "description": "A Guide to Kernel Exploitation: Attacking the Core discusses the theoretical techniques and approaches needed to develop reliable and effective kernel-level exploits, and applies them to different operating systems, namely, UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, and Windows. Concepts and tactics are presented categorically so that even when a specifically detailed vulnerability has been patched, the foundational information provided will help hackers in writing a newer, better attack; or help pen testers, auditors, and the like develop a more concrete design and defensive structure. The book is organized into four parts. Part I introduces the kernel and sets out the theoretical basis on which to build the rest of the book. Part II focuses on different operating systems and describes exploits for them that target various bug classes. Part III on remote kernel exploitation analyzes the effects of the remote scenario and presents new techniques to target remote issues. It includes a step-by-step analysis of the development of a reliable, one-shot, remote exploit for a real vulnerabilitya bug affecting the SCTP subsystem found in the Linux kernel. Finally, Part IV wraps up the analysis on kernel exploitation and looks at what the future may hold. Covers a range of operating system families — UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, Windows Details common scenarios such as generic memory corruption (stack overflow, heap overflow, etc.) issues, logical bugs and race conditions Delivers the reader from user-land exploitation to the world of kernel-land (OS) exploits/attacks, with a particular focus on the steps that lead to the creation of successful techniques, in order to give to the reader something more than just a set of tricks",

This book pinpoints the most dangerous hacks and exploits specific to networks, laying out the anatomy of these attacks including how to make your system more secure. You will discover the best ways to defend against these vicious hacks with step-by-step instruction and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable. The book consists of seven chapters that deal with the following attacks: denial of service; war dialing; penetration testing; protocol tunneling; spanning tree attacks; man-in-the-middle; and password replay. These attacks are not mutually exclusive and were chosen because they help illustrate different aspects of network security. The principles on which they rely are unlikely to vanish any time soon, and they allow for the possibility of gaining something of interest to the attacker, from money to high-value data. This book is intended to provide practical, usable information. However, the world of network security is evolving very rapidly, and the attack that works today may (hopefully) not work tomorrow.

More and more data and voice communications are going via wireless at some point between the sender and intended recipient. As a result, truly \"bulletproof\" wireless security is now more than a desirable feature--instead, it's a necessity to protect essential personal and business data from hackers and eavesdroppers. In this handy reference, Praphul Chandra gives you the conceptual and practical tools every RF, wireless, and network engineer needs for high-security wireless applications. Inside this book you'll find coverage of these essential topics: + Cryptographic protocols used in wireless networks. + Key-based protocols, including key exchange and authentication techniques + Various types of wireless network attacks, including reflection, session hijacks, and Fluhrer-Mantin-Shamir (FMS) attacks. + Encryption/decryption standards and methods. + Multi-layered security architectures. + Secure sockets layer (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS) protocols. + Cellular telephone network architectures and their vulnerabilities. + Modulation techniques, such as direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) And you'll also find coverage on such cutting-edge topics as security techniques for ad hoc networks and protecting Bluetooth networks. If you're serious about wireless security, then this title belongs on your reference bookshelf!",

    "description": "The Basics of Cyber Warfare provides readers with fundamental knowledge of cyber war in both theoretical and practical aspects. This book explores the principles of cyber warfare, including military and cyber doctrine, social engineering, and offensive and defensive tools, tactics and procedures, including computer network exploitation (CNE), attack (CNA) and defense (CND). Readers learn the basics of how to defend against espionage, hacking, insider threats, state-sponsored attacks, and non-state actors (such as organized criminals and terrorists). Finally, the book looks ahead to emerging aspects of cyber security technology and trends, including cloud computing, mobile devices, biometrics and nanotechnology. The Basics of Cyber Warfare gives readers a concise overview of these threats and outlines the ethics, laws and consequences of cyber warfare. It is a valuable resource for policy makers, CEOs and CIOs, penetration testers, security administrators, and students and instructors in information security. Provides a sound understanding of the tools and tactics used in cyber warfare. Describes both offensive and defensive tactics from an insider's point of view. Presents doctrine and hands-on techniques to understand as cyber warfare evolves with technology.",
